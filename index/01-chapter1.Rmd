## *Increased adiposity and associtions with disease* {-}

This chapter provides the context of the thesis. It briefly gives background on the problem of increased adiposity, the biology of adipose tissue, and diseases linking increased body mass index (BMI) and mortality. The chapter then briefly explores different measures of increased adiposity, hypothesis for underlying aetiology of disease development as a result of increased adiposity, the potential application of metabolites to understanding this aetiology, the concept of Mendelian randomization and how it can be used in conjunction with observational analyses, and it's benefits and limitations. The chapter finishes by proposing the idea of a pipeline, that the thesis will explore, that will guide researchers in large scale analyses such as this. The aims and objectives of the thesis are detailed at the end of the chapter.

## Background {#background}

Globally, the prevelance of overweight (BMI of 25--29.9 kg/m^2^) and obesity (BMI > 30 kg/m^2^) is 39% and 13% respectively[@WorldHealthOrganisation2018](Figure \@ref(fig:overweight-graph) and \@ref(fig:obesity-graph)). Obesity is estimated to be responsible for 8% of global deaths[@Stanaway2018] and this number is likely to rise as the prevalnce of obesity increases[@Ng2014; @NCD-RisC2016; @Abarca-Gomez2017]. <br>

In the crudest sense, BMI is a measure of weight given an adjustment of height and thus an assessment of ones proportions. Given this simplicity and the association with a range of health outcomes (see section \@ref(BMI-and-disease)), it is the most common measure of increased adiposity. A normal weight classification is a BMI of 18.5--24.9 kg/m^2^, with an underweight class below this. Underweight is a specific condition that may be secondary to or symptomatic of an underlying disease and is not within the scope of this thesis. <br>

## Adipose tissue {#adipose-tissue}
Ones weight is made up of two components, fat free mass and fat mass. Fat free mass encompasses muscle, bone and water mass. Fat mass is an all encompassing term for adipose tissue. Adipose tissue is predominantly made up of adipocytes, with other tissues and cells such as the stromal vascular fraction, preadipocytes and fibroblasts making up smaller proportions[@Frayn2003; @Cohen2016; @Luo2016]. The main function of adipose tissue is energy storage in the form of lipids, with a secondary function to insulate and cushion the body. These two functions can broadly be separated into two types of adipose tissue, white and brown[@Cohen2016]. In addition to these functions adipose tissue is considered an endocrine organ, responsive to afferent signalling as well as being a prolific signaller itself[@Kershaw2004]. Advances in genetics and availability of large population studies has enabled the identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and genes associated with adipose tissue[@Dahlman2010]. <br>

### Energy storage
Energy storage is determined by energy intake and energy expenditure. An increase or decrease in one leads to a change in total energy storage. Energy stores are comprised primarily of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats. For protein, there is little change in total energy stores outside of a growth stimulus (i.e. exercise is needed to increase protein stores)[@Galgani2008]. Carbohydrate stores fluctuate markedly throughout the day as a result of limited storage capacity and the fact that they comprise the majority of energy production[@Galgani2008]. Fats are the largest energy store, with daily intake ~1% of their total store[@Galgani2008], similar to proteins. Because of tight controls over protein and limited availability of carbohydrate storage, fat storage is the only expandable reservoir of excess energy intake[@Frayn2003; @Galgani2008]. As a result, an energy imbalance will be reflected in the fat stores and not elsewhere[@Frayn2003; @Galgani2008]. <br>

Excess energy is stored in adipocytes in the form of lipid droplets (triglycerides; Figure \@ref(fig:adipocyte)) via lipogenesis. The release of these fat stores, in the form of fatty acids, occurs through lipolysis. As the main store of excess energy, triglycerides provide an accurate reflection of energy imbalance, while adipocytes reflect the deposition and mobilisation of triglycerides[@Frayn2003]. Deposition and mobilisation of triglycerides, depicted in Figure \@ref(fig:adipocyte), is a product of a complex interplay of genetic and hormonal signals with leptin and insulin playing key roles[@Amitani2013]. Insulin stimulates the conversion of acetyl-CoA to triglycerides by encouraging uptake of glucose by adipocytes and promoting expression of SREBP1 (sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1). SREBP1 regulates fatty acid, triglyceride and cholesterol synthesis[@Frayn2003; @Luo2016]. In addition, lipoprotein lipase plays a key role in hydrolysing circulating triglycerides into fatty acids enabling their uptake by adipocytes[@Frayn2003]. Though they can expand, Individual adipocytes have limited storage capacity for triglycerides. Once *full* adipocytes have the ability to multiply[@Frayn2003]. The amount of expansion adipocytes can achieve is limited[@Frayn2003; @Gray2007] and thought to be influential in the rate of adipogenesis, the rate of fat mobilisation around the body and the development of disease[@Gray2007].<br>

*Figure \@ref(fig:adipocyte), reproduced from Frayn et al. (2003)[@Frayn2003], depicts influences on adipocytes that result in fat storage. Stimuli such as insulin result in positive (+) fat deposition, while other stimuli such as cortisol may result in positive or negative (-) fat deposition depedning on the location of the adipocyte within the body.

### Insulation and cushioning
Energy storage of fats is managed predominantly by white adipose tissue. These deposits are located mainly within subcutaneous tissue. During infancy, brown adipose tissue is abundant, however as humans age these deposits *'whiten'* leaving few adult brown fat deposits. The remaining deposits of brown adipose tissue in adults are located around the neck, thoracic section of the spine, aortic body, and adrenal glands; all locations with high blood flow[@Cannon2004; @Luo2016]. Thermogenesis by these tissues is regulated by the hypothalamus and is achieved by uncoupling of the respiratory chain of oxidative phosphorylation via UCP1 (uncoupling protein 1). When this process is active, lipids and glucose are used as fuel[@Cannon2004]. Due to the abundant vascularization of areas where brown adipose tissue is located the heat generated from this process is quickly distributed via the circulatory system. In addition, white adipose tissue can undergo a *'beiging'* process taking on thermogenic properties of brown adipose tissue. Beige adipose tissue is a half way point between white and brown adipose tissue and is more widely dispersed than brown adipose tissue, being located mainly within subcutaneous white adipose tissue. Beige adipose tissue, much like brown adipose tissue, is cold activated but can be recruited through signalling that mimics the stressed state induced by cold. The *'beiging'* process is not well characterized but is thought to be a result of signalling changes during differentiation of preadipocytes[@Luo2016]. The *'beiging'* process is reversible but has been suggested as a therapeutic avenue for weight loss [@Cannon2004]. <br> 

### Signalling
It is important to consider adipose tissue as an organ in its own right. Not solely comrpised of adipocytes, adipose tissue includes a multitude of tissues and cells including connective and nerve tissues and immune cells. All respond to, and secrete, signalling molecules locally and systemically. It is thought this signalling is primarily to maintain appropriate energy stores and includes signals influencing deposition and mobilisation of fats and differntiation of new adipocytes[@Frayn2003; @Kershaw2004; @Luo2016]. Functionally, signalling molecules have metabolic effects and/or are involved in steroid hormone production[@Kershaw2004]. <br>

Adipogenesis, the process of adipocyte formation, has been well characterized and PPAR$y$ (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor $y$) is the master regulator[@Frayn2003; @Luo2016]. Overexpression of PPAR$y$ leads to differntiation and underexpression results in lipodystrophy. Other signalling molecules such as KLFs (Kruppel-like factors) and C/EBPs (CCAAT-enhancer-binding prteins) influence adipogeneises through PPAR$y$[@Luo2016]. Because of the master regulatory function of PPAR$y$, exploring regulatory function and expression has been considered as a potential therapeutic avenue for obesity[@Lee2014; @Luo2016]. Though not well characterized, brown adipocytes are thought be influenced heavily by PRDM16 and PGC1$a$, with the latter required for thermogenesis and not necessarily adipogenesis[@Luo2016]. The breakdown of stored triglycerides via lipolysis results in the release of fatty acids and glycerol molecules for oxidation and gluconeogenesis respectively. Fatty acids can also be broken down into ketone bodies via ketogenesis. While insulin abundance activates lipogenesis, the relative absence of insulin promotes lipogenesis. The lipolytic pathway, which is also activated by cAMP-dependent (cyclic adenosine monophospate) PKA (protein kinase A), relies on the function of ATGL (adipocyte triglyceride lipase) and HSL (hormone sensitive lipase) to catalyze the hydrolysis of triglycerides to di- and mono-glycerides respectively. Inhibition of ATGL can result in imparied lipolysis and obesity[@Schreiber2019]. <br>

The signalling molecules adipocytes produce, known as adipokines, are numerous and act on the auto- and endo-crine systems[@Lehr2012; @Fasshauer2015]. There are adipose deposit specific effects on expression and secretion of adipokines and the movement these adipokines can be expected to undertake; subcutaneous adipose tissue adipokines travel through the systemic system while visceral adipose tissue adipokines can travel via the portal system with direct access to the liver. Adipocyte receptors are also expressed differentially based on deposit location[@Kershaw2004]. The main adipokines (Figure \@ref(fig:adipokines)) produced by adipocytes are leptin and adiponecti which function to regulate metabolism and inflammation systemically. Other cells within the adipose tissue, including immune and endothelial cells, produce much of the other adipokines such as TNF$a$ (tumour necrosis factor $a$) and IL6 (interleukin 6)[@Luo2016]. Abnormal levels of adipokines are harmful, as they lead to impaired adipose tissue function and subsequent downstream effects such as insulin resistance[@Bluher2013; @Bluher2015; @Fasshauer2015; @Luo2016]. As adipose tissue abundance increases so too does the likelihood of abnormal leveles of adipokines. This is of particular interest as adipokine levels can change as a result of diseases such as obesity, thus introducing feed-back loops which serve to alter normal processes[@Bluher2013; @Fasshauer2015]. However, there are outstanding questions about how abnormal levels of adipokines leads to the development of disease[@Fasshauer2015]. For detailed discussion of adipokines and the pathways that lead to their production, which is not in the scope of this thesis, see[@Kershaw2004; @Bluher2013; @Bluher2015; @Fasshauer2015; @Luo2016].<br>

### Genetics
Production of adipokines, though partly a response of affernet signalling, is also a result of adipocyte genetics. This is also the case for lipogenesis, storage capacity, lipolysis, mobilisation of fat deposits and energy expenditure[@Dahlman2010]. A number of adipose specific genes have been identified including *LEP*[@Pan2018; @Ahn2019], *ADIPOQ*[@Achari2017], and *PPAR$y$*[@Lefterova2009; @Ahn2019] encoding the adipokines leptin and adiponectin and the adipose-specific transcription factor PPAR$y$. These, and other genes[@Ahn2019], are expressed differently in subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue as well as in non-adipose tissue[@Ahn2019]. Differential expression along with the presence of adipose-specific genes is associated with obesity and related diseases[@Ahn2019], for example *SLC19A3* is an adipose-specific gene[@Ahn2019] encoding a thiamine transporter; thiamine dependent enzymes have been associated with obesity[Maguire2018]. As adipocyte expandability is limited, and given that an excess of fatty acids results in increased adipogenesis[@Frayn2003; @Gray2007], it is possible that expandability is fixed by adipose-specifc genes and expression. This may have an impact on the development of diseases such as type-2 diabetes where incidence differs between different ancestral populations with the same BMI[@Ma2013a].

## BMI and disease {#BMI-and-disease}
With obesity responsible for 8% of premature deaths per-year[@Stanaway2018] and more people expected to be overweight or obese in the coming years[@Ng2014; @NCD-RisC2016; @Abarca-Gomez2017] it is important to understand the reasons leading to mortality. Manual literature searching however is prone to bias. Literature mining tools, though susceptible to publication and other biases, provide an alternative approach enabling a large number of artilces to be assesses in a semi-systematic way. MELODI[@Elsworth2018], a literature mining tool, was used to identify intermediate diseases between BMI and mortality. <br>

Briefly, MELODI creates individual article sets based on search terms ('body mass index' and 'mortality') and looks for enriched overlapping terms. MELODI uses PubMed and SemMedDDB to identify enriched terms. PubMed is a data base of health and biomedical research literature, and SemMedDB is a semantic predications repository built from PubMed citations. Identifying enriched overlapping terms is a two-step process. First, overlapping terms are identified. Second, the degree of overlap given the observed and expected frequency of terms across all articles not just those included in the article sets is quantified. <br>

All articles published from 01/01/2000--09/12/2019 (maximum number of articles per article set is 1,000,000) using the terms 'body mass idnex' as the source and 'mortality' as the outcome were included. Raw results are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/mattlee821/000_thesis/index/data/chapter1). A total of 187,951 and 787,451 articles were retrieved and included in the source and outcome article sets. Using the SemMedDB Triple results a total of `r nrow(MELODI)` enriched overlapping terms were identified. This included similar terms to 'body mass index' as the source, which were removed (n = `r nrow(MELODI_bmi_clna)`). A Bonferroni corrected p-value (`r signif(0.05/nrow(MELODI_bmi_clna), 2)`) removed `r nrow(MELODI_bmi_clna) - nrow(MELODI_bmi_clna_p)` terms. Terms were filtered for uniqueness (n = `r nrow(MELODI_bmi_clna_p_unique)`) and presence in the following categories: Age Group (n = `r nrow(MELODI_intermediates_unique_aggp)`), Bacterium (included because of confounding with pneumonia; n = `r nrow(MELODI_intermediates_unique_bact)`), finding (not an official MELODI category; n = `r nrow(MELODI_intermediates_unique_finding)`), general (not an official MELODI category; n = `r nrow(MELODI_intermediates_unique_general)`), Fungus (included because of confounding with pneumonia; n = `r nrow(MELODI_intermediates_unique_fngs)`), Health Care Activity (n = `r nrow(MELODI_intermediates_unique_hlca)`), Human (n = `r nrow(MELODI_intermediates_unique_humn)`), Injury or Poisoning (n = `r nrow(MELODI_intermediates_unique_inpo)`), Mammal (animal studies; n = `r nrow(MELODI_intermediates_unique_mamm)`), Patient or Disabled Group (n = `r nrow(MELODI_intermediates_unique_podg)`), Population Group (n = `r nrow(MELODI_intermediates_unique_popg)`), Sign or Symptom (n = `r nrow(MELODI_intermediates_unique_sosy)`), Virus (included because of confounding; n = `r nrow(MELODI_intermediates_unique_virs)`). <br>

The following terms were removed and merged into immunocompromised host: infections, hospital and opportunistic infections. The following terms were removed because of duplication under different names: cardiac death, sudden death, and sudden cardiac death (merged into cessation of life); coronary arteriosclerosis (atherosclerosis);  cardiovascular morbidity, cardiac event, heart diseases, vascular diseases (cardiovascular diseases); depressed mood (depressive disorder); diabetes mellitus and insulin-dependent (diabetic); metabolic diseases (metabolic syndrome). The following terms were removed because they were top-level categories that could either include a wide variety of terms already included or were duplicated by other terms: chronic disease, critical illness, disability, pregnancy complications and perinatal morbidity (included in pregnancy category), pathogenesis. As a result of filtering a total of `r nrow(MELODI_intermediates_unique_final)` terms remained. These terms were combined into `r nlevels(MELODI_final_table$Category)` categories: `r levels(MELODI_final_table$Category)`. The 'other' category included traits that did not fit into one of any of the other categories and which did not have aligned traits to form a separate category (Table \@ref(tab:MELODI-analysis)). The majority of intermediates were cardiovascular related. <br> 

These results highlight the broad array of intermediate diseases and complications related to BMI across a very large body of the scientific literature. It should be noted that the search did not include articles prior to the year 2000 and focussed only on those archived by PubMed. Enrichment aims to reduce the noise introduced when searching hundreds of thousands of articles, however manual curation, which will hold its own biases, is needed in order to obtain an informative list of enriched terms. <br>

```{r MELODI-analysis, echo=FALSE}
data <- MELODI_final_table
data <- data[order(data$Category),]
# make table
if (doc.type == "docx") { 
  x <- flextable(data = data) %>%
    set_caption('Intermediates between body mass index and mortality identified using the literature mining tool MELODI')
  } else { 

if (doc.type != "docx") { 
  x <- knitr::kable(
    (data), longtable = TRUE, booktabs = TRUE,
    caption = 'Intermediates between body mass index and mortality identified using the literature mining tool MELODI', row.names = F)
  x <- kable_styling(x, full_width = F) 
} else {

}
}

```

## Additional measures of increased adiposity {#additional-measures}
Though a very simple and effective measure of increased adiposity, BMI does not have the resolution to accurately measure an individual’s body composition[@Pischon2008; @Romero-Corral2008; @Okorodudu2010; @Pasco2012]. There are alose questions around the relationship with mortality[@Flegal2013; @Lee2015; @Elagizi2018]. Though these questions are likely a result of confounding and other biases[@Banack2013; @Willett2013; @Khan2018] evidence has pointed to a more important role for fat deposition in the relationship with mortality[@Sahakyan2015; @Hamer2017]. As such, complimnetary assesment of increased adiposity, using a combination of body composition measures, may provide additional information into the associations with disease[@WorldHealthOrganisation2008; @Collaboration2009]. <br> 

Alongside BMI, frequently used measures include waist hip ratio (WHR) and body fat percent (BF). Both measures are used clinically and for population-based research to provide more accurate measures of an individuals body composition. Whereas BMI provides an overall approximation of an individuals proportions, WHR provides an approximate assessment of the deposition of fat around the body; deposition of fat at the waist is indicative of greater visceral fat[@WorldHealthOrganisation2008]. BF by its nature of measuring fat mass directly rather than estimating it like BMI, provides a more accurate estimation of body composition[@WorldHealthOrganisation2000]. Both BMI and WHR have a single measurement while BF can be measured in a a number of different ways including estimations based on WHR and BMI. Imaging measures, such as dual-emission X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), enable direct measurement of adipose tissue and are the most accurate measure of BF. <br>

Like BMI[@Flegal2013; @Lee2015; @Elagizi2018], WHR[@Jenkins2018; @Pischon2008; @Rost2018; @Mørkedal2011; @Dong2018] and BF[@Jenkins2018; @Dong2018; @Lee2018; @Bigaard2004] are also associated with mortality. Performing a manual literature search for WHR and the categories identified in the MELODI analysis (Table \@ref(tab:MELODI-analysis)) reveals a number of associations including: cancer[@Barberio2019], cardiovascular[@Dobbelsteyn2001; @Yusuf2005], kidney[@Elsayed2008], liver[@Sahlman2020], neurological/behavioural[@Wiltink2013; @Dye2017], pregnancy[@Basraon2016], respiratory[@Price2006a] and diabetes[@Qiao2010]. For BF, fewer studies were repoerted in the lietrature with associations including: cancer[@Lee2018], cardiovascular[@Romero-Corral2010; @Lee2018], kidney[@Oh2014], respiratory[@Lee2018], and diabetes[@Jo2018]. <br>

## Underlying aetiology {#underlying-aetiology}
Although associated with many of the same diseases, the underlying aeitology of the relationships between BMI, WHR and BF with these diseases is not clear. For some, the relationship with increased adiposity has been explained as a result of other factors, not least other diseases. This is particualry true for quality of life, where the presence of co-morbidities increases the likelihood of poorer quality of life. But there are also suggestion that stigmatisation as a result of increased fat mass may play a large role[@Bray2004; @Haslam2005]. Similalry, the relatiosnhip with many sleep complications is likely a result of chronic pulmonary diseases -- distribution of increased adiposity to the neck may also be important[@Bray2004; @Haslam2005; @Poulain2006]. <br>

Diabetes is perhaps the best studied of the diseases related to increased adiposity. Development is likely to follow a process of impaired glucose clearance as a result of increased adiposity, which leads to increased insulin resistance. There are likely wider metabolic changes that influence this process which are also a consequence of increased adiposity[@Bray2004; @Haslam2005; @Collaboration2009]. Respiratory diseases are likely a result of reductions in FEV1, FVC, lung and residual capacity, and expiratory reserve. Each of these is a consequence of weakend mucles and reduced compliance of the chest which can be caused by the physical burden of increased adiposity around the chest and lungs[@Haslam2005; @Poulain2006]. <br>

Unlike diabetes and respiratory diseases, most other diseases have a less well understood process of development as a result of increased adiposity. For cancer, increased adiposity is associated with many different types with hypotheses for these relationships differing based on the type of cancer. Metabolic, inflammatory and hormonal changes as a result of increased adiposity are propesed as leading to the development of a number of different cancers[@Bray2004; @Haslam2005; @Collaboration2009; @Bhaskaran2014]. In the case of cardiovascular disease, hypertenshion may be related to changes in: sympathetic activity, blood flow and viscosity, and dietary intake as a result of increased adiposity[@Bray2004; @Haslam2005; @Jayedi2018]. Some of these changes might similarly be a result of metabolic, inflammatory and hormonal changes. Both dyslipidemia and reductions in HDL result from increased adiiposity and these changes may be important in development of heart disease. The location of fat deposition may also be important, e.g. depsoition of adipose tissue around the heart may result in inflammation of the myocaridum, but this might also be subsequent to dyslipidemia and reduction in HDL [@Bray2004; @Haslam2005; @Collaboration2009; @Dagfinn2016]. Osteoarthritis, though likely a result of the physical burden of increased adiposity, may also be a product of changes to cartilage and bone metabolism[@Bray2004; @Haslam2005]. Similar metabolic changes may play a role in a number of other diseases. An increased risk of gallstones is associated with increased cholesterol[@Bray2004] and increased salt intake has been suggested as a potential link between increased adiposity and stroke[@Haslam2005; @Collaboration2009]. <br>

## Metabolites {#metabolites}
Many of the discussed diseases have hypothesised development processes involving metabolic, inflammatory and hormonal changes. As a complex signalling organ with both local and systemic effects, adipose tissue is likely to influence all three of these processes at both local and systemic levels. It is not within the scope of this thesis to investigate all three but recent advances in measurmeent methodologies and the availability of large, and deeply phenotyped population based studies may now provide the data necessary to investiagte metabolic effects. <br>

The metabolome, the bodies total abundance of small-molecules (metabolites), sits at the interface between genetic and non-genetic factors[@Griffin2006; @Su2014; @Chu2019]. Inclduing both endogenous and exogenous metabolites, as well as being influenced by the environment, the metabolome is a measurable link between genotype and phenotype[@Wishart2019]. The effects metabolites have on the body are far reaching and include post-translational modifications and transportation of smaller molecules and hormones[@Johnson2016; @Wishart2019]. These effects are under tight control during normal homeostasis but can be detrimental[@Griffin2006; @Johnson2016; @Wishart2019]. As such, understanding the physiological roles and the changes metabolites undergo during diseased states may help better undertsand the underlying aetiology of disease development. <br>

Measurement of individual metabolites is achieved predominantly through mass spectrometry (MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Both MS and NMR have differing limitations with full coverage of the metabolome not achieved by either. Complimentary usage of the two methods is desireable[@Fearnley2016], however as MS is destructive and both methods are costly this is not always possible. As such many population based studies have metabolomics data from only one measurement method limiting the number of metabolites available for analysis. However, the availability of well powered population studies with metabolome and matched genome-wide data has enabled a growth in genome-wide association studies (GWASs) investigating the metablome and identifying genes associated with metabolites[@Fearnley2016; @Chu2019]. These studies have revealed large variations in the hertability of metabolites and numerous loci associated with their abundances[@Shin2014; @Kettunen2016; @Long2017; @Gallois2019]. The public availability of these GWASs provides a unique opportunity to perform genetic epidemiology studies which can compliment the existing literature from observational assciation studies. <br>

Metabolites are expressed differently depending on the trait or disease being investigated. This is particularly evident in case control studies such as diabetes[@Guasch-Ferre2016] and cancer[@Liesenfeld2013; @Johnson2016], but also with complex traits such as BMI[@Moore2014; @Cirulli2019] as well as many more[@Wishart2018] - a searchable database of metabolite information, including links with disease, is available from [The Human Metabolome Database](hmdb.ca). These studies provide an overall assessment of the changes metabolites undergo as a result of different conditions but the relationship is not clear. Whether metabolites change as a result of a condition or lead to its development is an important question with potential clinical importance. Mutable, both from a genetic and non-genetic perspective, the metabolome can, with caution, be used to investigate the development of diseases[@Su2014; @Fearnley2016; @Chu2019]. <br>

A key aspect of future work investigating relationships between metabolites and diseases are the interactions metabolites have with one another. The metabolome is a complex system involving feedback and feedforward loops, this complexity means many metabolites are intercorrelated[@Rosato2018], have high genetic correlation[@Gallois2019] and share a common genetic architecture[@Shin2014; @Kettunen2016; @Long2017; @Gallois2019]. As such, a perturbation in a single metabolite rarely occurs in isolation. Investigating metabolites as grouped entities that represent the underlying complexity, rather than individual metabolites, may help to elucidate relationships with disease. <br>

## Mendelian randomization {#mendelian-randomization}
Studies investigating the associations between increased adipoisty and metabolites and metabolites and disease are important, and when conducted in optimal conditions provide information on the potential causes and consequences of altered metabolic states. Even with optimal conditions observational studies hold a number of limitations that can not easily be overcome. These limitations, such as confounding and reverse causation, can lead to biased results[@DaveySmith2014]. Steps can be taken to mitigate these limitations, such as including confounders in models, but these steps can only be taken so far. Conducting a randomised control trial would be an ideal situation. However, the large costs and time required to develop, implement and analyse results limits their use. An alternative approach is to utilise the large amounts of data that are publicly available or that can be accessed through institutions. Causal inference metholdologies have been established to exploit the availability of these data sets. <br>

Mendelian randomization (MR), described[@DaveySmith2003; @DaveySmith2003; @Davies2018] and reviewed[@Burgess2015; @Bowden2019] elsewhere, and accompanied by a [dictionary](https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/6yzs7) of terms[@Lawlor2019], is a statistcal methodology that uses genetic variants as instrumental variables to investigate the causal relationship between an exposure and outcome[@DaveySmith2003; @Smith2004]. Briefly, individuals inherit alleles randomly from their mother and father. Across a large population this leads to the even distribution of confounders between the effect- and non-effect alleles. As such, individuals differ because of the expressed allele rather than their environmental circumsatnces. This is analgous to a randomised control trial in which the effect allele and non-effect allele are the intervention and non-intervention arms of the trial. The principle of MR (Figure \@ref(fig:mr-dag)) relies upon three assumptions: (i) the instrumental variable is robsutly associated with the exposure, (ii) there is no independent association of the instrumental variable with the outcome other than through the exposure, (iii) the instrumental variable is independent of confounders, measured or unmeasured. <br>

Advances in methodologies have enabled MR studies to be conducted with both individual level, known as one-sample MR, and summary level data obtained from published GWASs[@Pierce2013], known as two-sample MR. Both approaches can be extended to include an intermediate (Figuer \@ref(fig:mr-dag2)) that sits on the causal pathway, known as two-step MR[@Relton2012]. In two-step MR (Figure \@ref(fig:mr-dag2)) all three assumptions must still be met and must be extended: (i) the instrumental variables must be robustly associated with the exposure or intermediate only, (ii) the instrumental variables for the exposure must not be associated with the inetrmediate or the outcome other than through the exposure, and the intermediate instrumental variables must not be associated with the exposure, and only with the outcome through the intermediate, (iii) the instrumental variables for the exposure and intermediate must not be associated with measured or unmeasured confounders. <br>

MR has been widely, and is increasingly,  used among researchers. The reassessment of many observational associations has provided strong evidence for the relationships between risk factors and diseases, but has also highlighted the biases and limitations of observational reserach[@Timpson2005; @CCGC2011; @Yarmolinsky2018]. MR is however not infallible. Among possible limitations, population stratification, horizontal pleiotropy and canalization are the most challenging to account for. Though one can restrict analyses to homogenous groups, use principal cmponents, and perform within family studies to examine and mitigate the effects of population stratification, biases (e.g. sampling bias) may still remain. Additionally, methods for assessing potential horizontal pleiotropy exist but formal assessment of the exclusion restriction assumption is not possible. Accounting for canalization is much harder and, though being aware of the underlying biology can inform ones analyses, methods for assessment do not exist. <br>

## Aims {#aims}
Increased adiposity is a global health concern. Many of the consequence of increased adiposity are known but the underlying aetiology is not well understood. Adipose tissue is a prolific signalling organ with systemic effects some of which are likely to affect the metabolome. Individual metabolites have been associated with many diseases but the compelxity of the network makes these analyses difficult. MR studies provide an opportuntiy to investiagte and disentangle the complex relationship between exposure, intermediate and outcome. These studies must be approached carefully given the interrelatedness of metabolites. In light of these considerations this thesis aims to: <br>

<br>

#### Identify metabolites that sit on the causal pathway from increased adiposity to disease

#### Produce a pipeline to guide researchers conducting MR analyses with metabolomic intermediates

<br>

## Objectives {#objectives}
In order to achieve these aims this thesis will investigate the following objectives. These objectives form the step-wise pipeline that the thesis will produce.

1. Gain braod overview of the literature in regards to the causal effects of increased adiposity. I will perform a systematic review (Chapter \@ref(chapter2)) of all MR studies in which a measure of increased adiposity was used as an exposure. The diseases identified in this work will guide the second step of the two-step MR analyses (Chapter \@ref(chapter9)). <br> 

\par

2. Identify and describe appropriate instrumentation of increased adiposity. The systematic review (Chapter \@ref(chapter2)) will provide information on current instrumentation practices for MR. I will use this information and test MR instrument assumptions using individual level data to select instruments for subsequent analyses (Chapters \@ref(chapter3) and \@ref(chapter4)). <br>

\par

3. Identify metabolites associated with increased adiposity in observational (Chapter \@ref(chapter4)) and MR settings (Chapter \@ref(chapter5)). 

\par

4. Gain overview of metabolic profiles to enable interpretation of analyses from Chapters \@ref(chapter4), \@ref(chapter5), and \@ref(chapter9) using visualisation tools (Chapter \@ref(chapter6)). <br>

\par

4. Implement methods to reduce the complexity of the metabolome and produce instruments for MR analyses (Chapters \@ref(chapter7) and \@ref(chapter8)). <br>

\par

5. Identify diseases associated with metabolites in an MR setting (Chapter \@ref(chapter9)) and present the investigated network of increased adiposity -> metabolites -> diseases. <br>
