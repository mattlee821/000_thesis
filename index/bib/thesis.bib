abstract = {Objective To determine whether body mass index, body fat percentage, and waist circumference influence smoking status and intensity.Design Mendelian randomisation study.Setting UK Biobank, with replication of results from the Tobacco and Genetics (TAG) consortium.Participants European descent participants from the UK Biobank cohort (n=372 791) and the TAG consortium (n=74 035).Main outcome measures Risk of current and past smoking, number of cigarettes smoked per day, age of smoking initiation.Results The Mendelian randomisation analysis indicated that each standard deviation increment in body mass index (4.6) increased the risk of being a smoker (odds ratio 1.18 (95{\%} confidence interval 1.13 to 1.23), P{\&}lt;0.001). This association was replicated in the TAG consortium data (1.19 (1.06 to 1.33), P=0.003). Furthermore, each standard deviation increment in body mass index was estimated to increase smoking intensity by 0.88 cigarettes per day (95{\%} confidence interval 0.50 to 1.26, P{\&}lt;0.001) in UK Biobank and 1.27 cigarettes per day in the TAG consortium (0.46 to 2.07, P=0.002). Similar results were also seen for body fat percentage and waist circumference in both UK Biobank and the TAG consortium data.Conclusions These results strongly suggest that higher adiposity influences smoking behaviour and could have implications for the implementation of public health interventions aiming to reduce the prevalence of these important risk factors.},

abstract = {Obesity is the most common metabolic disease in the world and its prevalence has been increasing over several decades. The World Health Organization (WHO) predicts that, by 2015, around 700 million adults will be obese (at least 10{\%} of the projected global population). This will be a huge health and economic burden with associated increases in diabetes, cardiovascular and musculoskeletal disease, and malignancy. While there has been little focus on the impact of obesity on respiratory disease, there are clear effects on pulmonary function and inflammation which will increase the prevalence and morbidity of lung disease. There is an inverse relationship between body mass index and forced expiratory volume in 1 s. Increases in body weight lead to worsening of pulmonary function. The reasons for this include the mechanical effects of truncal obesity and the metabolic effects of adipose tissue. Obesity is linked to a wide range of respiratory conditions including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, obstructive sleep apnoea, pulmonary embolic disease and aspiration pneumonia. It is important for those providing care for people with respiratory disease to appreciate the impact of obesity and to provide appropriate advice for weight reduction. Healthcare planners should consider the impact of obesity for future resources in respiratory care.},

abstract = {To understand the causal role of adiposity and ectopic fat in type 2 diabetes and cardiometabolic diseases, we aimed to identify two clusters of adiposity genetic variants: one with “adverse” metabolic effects (UFA) and the other with, paradoxically, “favorable” metabolic effects (FA). We performed a multivariate genome-wide association study using body fat percentage and metabolic biomarkers from UK Biobank and identified 38 UFA and 36 FA variants. Adiposity-increasing alleles were associated with an adverse metabolic profile, higher risk of disease, higher CRP, and higher fat in subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue, liver, and pancreas for UFA and a favorable metabolic profile, lower risk of disease, higher CRP and higher subcutaneous adipose tissue but lower liver fat for FA. We detected no sexual dimorphism. The Mendelian randomization studies provided evidence for a risk-increasing effect of UFA and protective effect of FA for type 2 diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, stroke, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and polycystic ovary syndrome. FA is distinct from UFA by its association with lower liver fat and protection from cardiometabolic diseases; it was not associated with visceral or pancreatic fat. Understanding the difference in FA and UFA may lead to new insights in preventing, predicting, and treating cardiometabolic diseases.},

The study population was classified into four groups: (1) normal weight with normal {\%}BF, (2) normal weight with high {\%}BF, (3) overweight with normal {\%}BF and (4) overweight with high {\%}BF.Main outcome measures ORs for ABG including pre-diabetes and undiagnosed diabetes (HbA1c ≥5.7{\%}, ≥39 mmol/mol).Results 64{\%} of population with normal BMI classification had a high {\%}BF. Prevalence of ABG in normal-weight group with high {\%}BF (13.5{\%}) is significantly higher than the overweight group with low {\%}BF (10.5{\%}, P{\&}lt;0.001). In an unadjusted model, the OR of ABG was significantly greater in adults at normal BMI with high {\%}BF compared with individuals at normal weight with low {\%}BF. In an adjusted model controlling for age, sex, race/ethnicity, first-degree-relative diabetes, vigorous-intensity activities and muscle strengthening activities, risks of ABG were greater in population with normal weight and high {\%}BF (OR 1.55, 95{\%} CI 1.01 to 2.38) and with overweight and low {\%}BF (OR 1.17, 95{\%} CI 0.69 to 1.98, P{\&}lt;0.05).Conclusions Integrating BMI with {\%}BF can improve in classification to direct screening and prevention efforts to a group currently considered healthy and avoid penalties and stigmatisation of other groups that are classified as high risk of ABG.},

abstract = {Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a growing cause of mortality in developing countries,  warranting investigation into its earlier detection for optimal disease management. A metabolomics based approach provides potential for noninvasive identification of biomarkers of colorectal carcinogenesis, as well as dissection of molecular pathways of pathophysiological conditions. Here, proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1HNMR) -based metabolomic approach was used to profile fecal metabolites of 68 CRC patients (stage I/II=20; stage III=25 and stage IV=23) and 32 healthy controls (HC). Pattern recognition through principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) was applied on 1H-NMR processed data for dimension reduction. OPLS-DA revealed that each stage of CRC could be clearly distinguished from HC based on their metabolomic profiles. Successive analyses identified distinct disturbances to fecal metabolites of CRC patients at various stages, compared with those in cancer free controls, including reduced levels of acetate, butyrate, propionate, glucose, glutamine, and elevated quantities of succinate, proline, alanine, dimethylglycine, valine, glutamate, leucine, isoleucine and lactate. These altered fecal metabolites potentially involved in the disruption of normal bacterial ecology, malabsorption of nutrients, increased glycolysis and glutaminolysis. Our findings revealed that the fecal metabolic profiles of healthy controls can be distinguished from CRC patients, even in the early stage (stage I/II), highlighting the potential utility of NMR-based fecal metabolomics fingerprinting as predictors of earlier diagnosis in CRC patients.},

In this article, we briefly review and critically assess the current state of research on the relationship between education and health in the United States. We then outline three directions for further research: We extend the conceptualization of education beyond attainment and demonstrate the centrality of the schooling process to health; we highlight the dual role of education as a driver of opportunity but also as a reproducer of inequality; and we explain the central role of specific historical sociopolitical contexts in which the education?health association is embedded. Findings from this research agenda can inform policies and effective interventions to reduce health disparities and improve health for all Americans.},

However, these studies have relied on univariate analyses, reducing power and limiting context-specific understanding. Here we aim to provide an integrated perspective of the genetic basis of metabolites by leveraging the Finnish Metabolic Syndrome In Men (METSIM) cohort, a unique genetic resource which contains metabolic measurements, mostly lipids, across distinct time points as well as information on statin usage. We increase effective sample size by an average of two-fold by applying the Covariates for Multi-phenotype Studies (CMS) approach, identifying 588 significant SNP-metabolite associations, including 228 new associations. Our analysis pinpoints a small number of master metabolic regulator genes, balancing the relative proportion of dozens of metabolite levels. We further identify associations to changes in metabolic levels across time as well as genetic interactions with statin at both the master metabolic regulator and genome-wide level.},

Here, we take advantage of recent technical and methodological advances to examine the role of common genetic variants on several obesity-related traits. By examining {\textgreater}4,000 Sardinians, we show that a specific genetic variant, rs9930506, and other nearby variants on human Chromosome 16 are associated with body mass index, hip circumference, and total body weight. The variants overlap FTO, a gene with poorly understood function. Further studies of the region may implicate new biological pathways affecting susceptibility to obesity. We also show that the association is not restricted to Sardinia but is also seen in independent samples of European Americans and Hispanic Americans. This finding is particularly important because obesity is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Although metabolic profiles have been associated with chronic disease risk, lack of temporal stability of metabolite levels could limit their use in epidemiological investigations. The present study aims to evaluate the reliability over a two-year period of 158 metabolites and compare reliability over time in fasting and non-fasting serum samples. METHODS: Metabolites were measured with the AbsolueIDQp180 kit (Biocrates, Innsbruck, Austria) by mass spectrometry and included acylcarnitines, amino acids, biogenic amines, hexoses, phosphatidylcholines and sphingomyelins. Measurements were performed on repeat serum samples collected two years apart in 27 fasting men from Turin, Italy, and 39 non-fasting women from Utrecht, The Netherlands, all participating in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study. Reproducibility was assessed by estimating intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) in multivariable mixed models. RESULTS: In fasting samples, a median ICC of 0.70 was observed. ICC values were {\textless}0.50 for 48{\%} of amino acids, 27{\%} of acylcarnitines, 18{\%} of lysophosphatidylcholines and 4{\%} of phosphatidylcholines. In non-fasting samples, the median ICC was 0.54. ICC values were {\textless}0.50 for 71{\%} of acylcarnitines, 48{\%} of amino acids, 44{\%} of biogenic amines, 36{\%} of sphingomyelins, 34{\%} of phosphatidylcholines and 33{\%} of lysophosphatidylcholines. Overall, reproducibility was lower in non-fasting as compared to fasting samples, with a statistically significant difference for 19-36{\%} of acylcarnitines, phosphatidylcholines and sphingomyelins. CONCLUSION: A single measurement per individual may be sufficient for the study of 73{\%} and 52{\%} of the metabolites showing ICCs {\textgreater}0.50 in fasting and non-fasting samples, respectively. ICCs were higher in fasting samples that are preferable to non-fasting.},

abstract = {A conventional Mendelian randomization analysis assesses the causal effect of a risk factor on an outcome by using genetic variants that are solely associated with the risk factor of interest as instrumental variables. However, in some cases, such as the case of triglyceride level as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, it may be difficult to find a relevant genetic variant that is not also associated with related risk factors, such as other lipid fractions. Such a variant is known as pleiotropic. In this paper, we propose an extension of Mendelian randomization that uses multiple genetic variants associated with several measured risk factors to simultaneously estimate the causal effect of each of the risk factors on the outcome. This "multivariable Mendelian randomization" approach is similar to the simultaneous assessment of several treatments in a factorial randomized trial. In this paper, methods for estimating the causal effects are presented and compared using real and simulated data, and the assumptions necessary for a valid multivariable Mendelian randomization analysis are discussed. Subject to these assumptions, we demonstrate that triglyceride-related pathways have a causal effect on the risk of coronary heart disease independent of the effects of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol.},

abstract = {Studies have reported conflicting results on the association between body mass index (BMI) and prognosis of colorectal cancer. Therefore, we have conducted a meta-analysis of prospective studies, which examined the association of pre- and post-diagnostic BMI with colorectal cancer-specific mortality and all-cause mortality in patients with colorectal cancer. We searched Medline and EMBASE database published between 1970 and September 2014. A total of 508 articles were identified, of which 16 prospective cohort studies were included for the current meta-analysis. The analysis included 58,917 patients who were followed up over a period ranging from 4.9 to 20 years (median: 9.9 years). We found that being underweight before cancer diagnosis was associated with increased all-cause mortality (Relative risk [RR]: 1.63, 95{\%} CI: 1.18-2.23, p {\textless} 0.01) and being obese (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m(2)) before cancer diagnosis was associated with increased colorectal cancer-specific mortality (RR: 1.22, 95{\%} CI: 1.003-1.35, p {\textless} 0.01) and all-cause mortality (RR: 1.25, 95{\%} CI: 1.14-1.36, p {\textless} 0.01). On the other hand, being underweight (RR: 1.33, 95{\%} CI: 1.20-1.47, p {\textless} 0.01), obese (RR: 1.08, 95{\%} CI: 1.03-1.3, p {\textless} 0.01), and class II/III obese (BMI ≥ 35 kg/m(2); RR: 1.13, 95{\%} CI: 1.04-1.23, p {\textless} 0.01) after diagnosis were associated with significantly increased all-cause mortality. Being obese prior to diagnosis of colorectal cancer was associated with increased colorectal cancer-specific mortality and all-cause mortality, whereas being obese after diagnosis was associated with increased all-cause mortality. The associations with being underweight may reflect reverse causation. Maintaining a healthy body weight should be discussed with colorectal cancer survivors.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine if body mass index (BMI) influences tumor expression of  HER-2/neu, estrogen and progesterone receptors (ER/PR), and survival in women with endometrial adenocarcinoma. METHODS: Patients diagnosed between January 1992 and December 2001 with endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the uterus were identified. Clinical and pathologic data were retrospectively collected. HER-2/neu, estrogen and progesterone receptor expression were determined by immunohistochemistry. Differences in these variables and other prognostic factors were analyzed and correlated with effect on survival. RESULTS: One-hundred-sixty-five patients were included in this analysis. Lower BMI was associated with high stage (p=0.04) and HER-2/neu expression (p=0.04). Black race, high grade, high stage and lack of ER/PR expression were all associated with decreased survival. Despite having better prognostic factors, women with a BMI {\textgreater}25 had a lower survival than women with a BMI {\textless}25 (p=0.36). When five-year survival rates were calculated for BMI category and stratified by prognostic factors, for almost every high risk factor, survival was lower in overweight patients. CONCLUSION: In patients with endometrioid adenocarcinoma, low BMI is associated with high stage and tumor expression of HER-2/neu. Despite better prognostic factors, overweight women experience poorer survival.},

abstract = {Meta-analyses are typically used to estimate the overall/mean of an outcome of interest. However, inference about between-study variability, which is typically modelled using a between-study variance parameter, is usually an additional aim. The DerSimonian and Laird method, currently widely used by default to estimate the between-study variance, has been long challenged. Our aim is to identify known methods for estimation of the between-study variance and its corresponding uncertainty, and to summarise the simulation and empirical evidence that compares them. We identified 16 estimators for the between-study variance, seven methods to calculate confidence intervals, and several comparative studies. Simulation studies suggest that for both dichotomous and continuous data the estimator proposed by Paule and Mandel and for continuous data the restricted maximum likelihood estimator are better alternatives to estimate the between-study variance. Based on the scenarios and results presented in the published studies, we recommend the Q-profile method and the alternative approach based on a 'generalised Cochran between-study variance statistic' to compute corresponding confidence intervals around the resulting estimates. Our recommendations are based on a qualitative evaluation of the existing literature and expert consensus. Evidence-based recommendations require an extensive simulation study where all methods would be compared under the same scenarios.},

@article{Cohen2016,
abstract = {The worldwide epidemic of obesity and type 2 diabetes has greatly increased interest in the biology and physiology of adipose tissues. Adipose (fat) cells are specialized for the storage of energy in the form of triglycerides, but research in the last few decades has shown that fat cells also play a critical role in sensing and responding to changes in systemic energy balance. White fat cells secrete important hormone-like molecules such as leptin, adiponectin, and adipsin to influence processes such as food intake, insulin sensitivity, and insulin secretion. Brown fat, on the other hand, dissipates chemical energy in the form of heat, thereby defending against hypothermia, obesity, and diabetes. It is now appreciated that there are two distinct types of thermogenic fat cells, termed brown and beige adipocytes. In addition to these distinct properties of fat cells, adipocytes exist within adipose tissue, where they are in dynamic communication with immune cells and closely influenced by innervation and blood supply. This review is intended to serve as an introduction to adipose cell biology and to familiarize the reader with how these cell types play a role in metabolic disease and, perhaps, as targets for therapeutic development.},

@article{Wells2007,
abstract = {Sexual dimorphism in human body composition is evident from fetal life, but emerges primarily during puberty. At birth, males have a similar fat mass to females but are longer and have greater lean mass. Such differences remain detectable during childhood; however, females enter puberty earlier and undergo a more rapid pubertal transition, whereas boys have a substantially longer growth period. After adjusting for dimorphism in size (height), adult males have greater total lean mass and mineral mass, and a lower fat mass than females. These whole-body differences are complemented by major differences in tissue distribution. Adult males have greater arm muscle mass, larger and stronger bones, and reduced limb fat, but a similar degree of central abdominal fat. Females have a more peripheral distribution of fat in early adulthood; however, greater parity and the menopause both induce a more android fat distribution with increasing age. Sex differences in body composition are primarily attributable to the action of sex steroid hormones, which drive the dimorphisms during pubertal development. Oestrogen is important not only in body fat distribution but also in the female pattern of bone development that predisposes to a greater female risk of osteoporosis in old age. Disorders of sex development are associated with significant abnormalities of body composition, attributable largely to their impact on mechanisms of hormonal regulation.},

abstract = {The informativeness of blood pressure, obesity and serum lipids associated with cardiovascular events may depend on how the indices are expressed, and mid blood pressure, waist-to-hip ratio adjusted for body-mass index (BMI) and the ratio of total to HDL cholesterol may be more informative than other expressions. Our aim was to study the informativeness of indices of blood pressure, obesity and serum lipids associated with ischaemic heart disease mortality in a large, homogeneous population. Blood pressure, weight, height, waist and hip circumference, total and HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides were measured at baseline (1995-1997) in 28,158 men and 32,573 women. Information on deaths from ischaemic heart disease (IHD) was obtained from the Causes of Death Registry in Norway from baseline until the end of 2007. Informativeness was analysed using the difference in twice the log-likelihood of a Cox model with and without each index. During 11 years of follow-up, 597 men and 418 women had died from IHD. Systolic blood pressure in men and pulse pressure in women were the most informative predictors of blood pressure, and waist-to-hip ratio adjusted for BMI was the most informative expression of obesity in both men and women. Among serum lipids, the most informative predictor was the ratio of total cholesterol to HDL cholesterol. Using more informative expressions of conventional risk factors for ischemic heart disease may improve both the validity and precision of estimates of risk, and may be useful both clinically and for preventive purposes.},

Knowledge of the possible influence of dietary habits on circulating adiponectin, a molecule with putative antiinflammatory properties, may be helpful in preventing atherosclerosis and type 2 diabetes.Methods: The association between dietary fat, as inferred from plasma fatty acid composition (gas–liquid chromatography), and circulating adiponectin (RIA) was evaluated in 116 healthy individuals.Results: The proportion of saturated fatty acids in plasma was significantly associated with circulating adiponectin concentration (r = −0.24; P = 0.01). Specifically, percentage of palmitic acid (C16:0) was significantly associated with lower adiponectin concentration (r = −0.28; P = 0.002), particularly among women (r = −0.37; P = 0.02) and nonsmokers (r = −0.30; P = 0.007). Percentage of myristic acid (C14:0) was also significantly associated with lower adiponectin among nonsmokers (r = −0.26; P = 0.02) and women (r = −0.39; P = 0.01). The other fatty acids were not significantly associated with adiponectin except for eicosanoic acid (C20:1 $\omega$-9), which was significantly and positively associated with adiponectin in all individuals (r = 0.23; P = 0.01). This latter association was most significant in smokers (r = 0.43; P = 0.007). In a multivariate regression analysis to predict circulating adiponectin, after controlling for age, body mass index, waist-to-hip ratio, and the individual remaining fatty acids, the percentages of palmitic (P = 0.005) and eicosanoic acid (P = 0.03) contributed independently (6{\%} and 3{\%}, respectively) to adiponectin variance. Among nonsmokers, the percentages of palmitic acid (P = 0.01) and $\omega$-3 fatty acids contributed 8{\%} and 7{\%}, respectively, to adiponectin variance. Among smokers, the percentage of eicosanoic acid (P = 0.03) contributed to 10{\%} of adiponectin variance, independently of body mass index, age, waist-to hip ratio, and the remaining individual fatty acids.Conclusions: Saturated and $\omega$-3 fatty acids of dietary origin (as inferred from plasma fatty acid concentration) are associated with circulating adiponectin concentrations in healthy humans. The proportion of eicosanoic acid also appears to be positively associated with circulating adiponectin. The knowledge of how these interactions occur may be helpful in the planning of dietary measures aimed at the modulation of inflammatory activity.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancers (CRC) are associated with perturbations in cellular  amino acids, nucleotides, pentose-phosphate pathway carbohydrates, and glycolytic, gluconeogenic, and tricarboxylic acid intermediates. A non-targeted global metabolome approach was utilized for exploring human CRC, adjacent mucosa, and stool. In this pilot study, we identified metabolite profile differences between CRC and adjacent mucosa from patients undergoing colonic resection. Metabolic pathway analyses further revealed relationships between complex networks of metabolites. METHODS: Seventeen CRC patients participated in this pilot study and provided CRC, adjacent mucosa {\~{}}10 cm proximal to the tumor, and stool. Metabolomes were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). All of the library standard identifications were confirmed and further analyzed via MetaboLync(TM) for metabolic network interactions. RESULTS: There were a total of 728 distinct metabolites identified from colonic tissue and stool matrices. Nineteen metabolites significantly distinguished CRC from adjacent mucosa in our patient-matched cohort. Glucose-6-phosphate and fructose-6-phosphate demonstrated 0.64-fold and 0.75-fold lower expression in CRC compared to mucosa, respectively, whereas isobar: betaine aldehyde, N-methyldiethanolamine, and adenylosuccinate had 2.68-fold and 1.88-fold higher relative abundance in CRC. Eleven of the 19 metabolites had not previously been reported for CRC relevance. Metabolic pathway analysis revealed significant perturbations of short-chain fatty acid metabolism, fructose, mannose, and galactose metabolism, and glycolytic, gluconeogenic, and pyruvate metabolism. In comparison to the 500 stool metabolites identified from human CRC patients, only 215 of those stool metabolites were also detected in tissue. This CRC and stool metabolome investigation identified novel metabolites that may serve as key small molecules in CRC pathogenesis, confirmed the results from previously reported CRC metabolome studies, and showed networks for metabolic pathway aberrations. In addition, we found differences between the CRC and stool metabolomes. CONCLUSIONS: Stool metabolite profiles were limited for direct associations with CRC and adjacent mucosa, yet metabolic pathways were conserved across both matrices. Larger patient-matched CRC, adjacent non-cancerous colonic mucosa, and stool cohort studies for metabolite profiling are needed to validate these small molecule differences and metabolic pathway aberrations for clinical application to CRC control, treatment, and prevention.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Adiponectin, a circulating adipocyte-derived protein, has insulin-sensitizing, anti-inflammatory, antiatherogenic, and cardiomyocyte-protective properties in animal models. However, the systemic effects of adiponectin in humans are unknown. Our aims were to define the metabolic profile associated with higher blood adiponectin concentration and investigate whether variation in adiponectin concentration affects the systemic metabolic profile. METHODS AND RESULTS: We applied multivariable regression in ≤5909 adults and Mendelian randomization (using cis-acting genetic variants in the vicinity of the adiponectin gene as instrumental variables) for analyzing the causal effect of adiponectin in the metabolic profile of ≤37 545 adults. Participants were largely European from 6 longitudinal studies and 1 genome-wide association consortium. In the multivariable regression analyses, higher circulating adiponectin was associated with higher high-density lipoprotein lipids and lower very-low-density lipoprotein lipids, glucose levels, branched-chain amino acids, and inflammatory markers. However, these findings were not supported by Mendelian randomization analyses for most metabolites. Findings were consistent between sexes and after excluding high-risk groups (defined by age and occurrence of previous cardiovascular event) and 1 study with admixed population. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that blood adiponectin concentration is more likely to be an epiphenomenon in the context of metabolic disease than a key determinant.},

abstract = {In premenopausal women, the ovaries are the principle source of estradiol, which functions as a circulating hormone to act on distal target tissues. However, in postmenopausal women when the ovaries cease to produce estrogen, and in men, this is no longer the case, because estradiol is no longer solely an endocrine factor. Instead, it is produced in a number of extragonadal sites and acts locally at these sites as a paracrine or even intracrine factor. These sites include the mesenchymal cells of adipose tissue including that of the breast, osteoblasts and chondrocytes of bone, the vascular endothelium and aortic smooth muscle cells, and numerous sites in the brain. Thus, circulating levels of estrogens in postmenopausal women and in men are not the drivers of estrogen action, they are reactive rather than proactive. This is because in these cases circulating estrogen originates in the extragonadal sites where it acts locally, and if it escapes local metabolism then it enters the circulation. Therefore, circulating levels reflect rather than direct estrogen action in postmenopausal women and in men. Tissue-specific regulation of CYP19 expression is achieved through the use of distinct promoters, each of which is regulated by different hormonal factors and second messenger signaling pathways. Thus, in the ovary, CYP19 expression is regulated by FSH which acts through cyclic AMP via the proximal promoter II, whereas in placenta the distal promoter I.1 regulates CYP19 expression in response to retinoids. In adipose tissue and bone by contrast, another distal promoter—promoter I.4—drives CYP19 expression under the control of glucocorticoids, class 1 cytokines and TNF$\alpha$. The importance of this unique aspect of the tissue-specific regulation of aromatase expression lies in the fact that the low circulating levels of estrogens which are observed in postmenopausal women have little bearing on the concentrations of estrogen in, for example, a breast tumor, which can reach levels at least one order of magnitude greater than those present in the circulation, due to local synthesis within the breast. Thus, the estrogen which is responsible for breast cancer development, for the maintenance of bone mineralization and for the maintenance of cognitive function is not circulating estrogen but rather that which is produced locally at these specific sites within the breast, bone and brain. In breast adipose of breast cancer patients, aromatase activity and CYP19 expression are elevated. This occurs in response to tumor-derived factors such as prostaglandin E2 produced by breast tumor fibroblasts and epithelium as well as infiltrating macrophages. This increased CYP19 expression is associated with a switch in promoter usage from the normal adipose-specific promoter I.4 to the cyclic AMP responsive promoter, promoter II. Since these two promoters are regulated by different cohorts of transcription factors and coactivators, it follows that the differential regulation of CYP19 expression via alternative promoters in disease-free and cancerous breast adipose tissue may permit the development of selective aromatase modulators (SAMs) that target the aberrant overexpression of aromatase in cancerous breast, whilst sparing estrogen synthesis in other sites such as normal adipose tissue, bone and brain.},

abstract = {This work demonstrates how computational and physical modelling of the positron emission tomography (PET) image acquisition process for a state-of-the-art integrated PET and magnetic resonance imaging (PET-MR) system can produce images comparable to the manufacturer. The GE SIGNA PET/MR scanner is manufactured by General Electric and has time-of-flight (TOF) capabilities of about 390 ps. All software development took place in the Software for Tomographic Image Reconstruction (STIR: http://stir.sf.net) library, which is a widely used open source software to reconstruct data as exported from emission tomography scanners. The new software developments will be integrated into STIR, providing the opportunity for researchers worldwide to establish and expand their image reconstruction methods. Furthermore, this work is of particular significance as it provides the first validation of TOF PET image reconstruction for real scanner datasets using the STIR library. This paper presents the methodology, analysis, and critical issues encountered in implementing an independent reconstruction software package. Acquired PET data were processed via several appropriate algorithms which are necessary to produce an accurate and precise quantitative image. This included mathematical, physical and anatomical modelling of the patient and simulation of various aspects of the acquisition. These included modelling of random coincidences using ‘singles' rates per crystals, detector efficiencies and geometric effects. Attenuation effects were calculated by using the STIR's attenuation correction model. Modelling all these effects within the system matrix allowed the reconstruction of PET images which demonstrates the metabolic uptake of the administered radiopharmaceutical. These implementations were validated using measured phantom and clinical datasets. The developments are tested using the ordered subset expectation maximisation (OSEM) and the more recently proposed kernelised expectation maximisation (KEM) algorithm which incorporates anatomical information from MR images into PET reconstruction.},

abstract = {Insulin resistance, most commonly in the context of obesity, is the main risk factor for type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases.Several pro-inflammatory cytokines (such as tumour-necrosis factor and interleukin-6), signalling proteins and endoplasmic-reticulum stress are associated with the development of insulin resistance.Adipose tissue is the largest endocrine organ in humans and releases large amounts of adipocytokines — mediators that are mainly, but not exclusively, synthesized by adipocytes in white adipose tissue. Adiponectin and leptin are the two most abundant adipocytokines.Adipose tissue contributes to the development of insulin resistance, not only by the synthesis of adipocytokines, but also by the production of many other pro-inflammatory mediators.Obesity is associated with increased macrophage infiltration of adipose tissue, and these macrophages might contribute to the chronic inflammatory response that is observed in obesity and insulin resistance.Adiponectin is synthesized mainly by adipocytes. It suppresses macrophage functions and inflammatory processes throughout the body, and decreases insulin resistance.Leptin, an adipocytokine that was identified more than a decade ago, links nutritional status with neuroendocrine and immune functions. In contrast to adiponectin, serum levels of leptin are increased in people who are obese and this adipocytokine has several pro-inflammatory properties.Resistin, another pro-inflammatory adipocytokine, seems to have different functions in mice and humans. It is potentially involved in the regulation of insulin resistance and has many pro-inflammatory functions.Visfatin mimics insulin functions and thereby decreases insulin resistance. Its initial identification as pre-B-cell colony-enhancing factor (PBEF) indicates that it has an important role in inflammatory processes, again supporting the close relationship between inflammation and insulin resistance.},

The methodologies considered in this unit focus on the processes of conducting targeted metabolomics experiments, and the advantages of this general approach are highlighted herein.

abstract = {Obesity is a major risk factor for a wide range of cardiometabolic diseases, however the impact of specific aspects of body morphology remains poorly understood. We combined the GWAS summary statistics of fourteen anthropometric traits from UK Biobank through principal component analysis to reveal four major independent axes summarizing 99{\%} of genetically driven variation in body shape and size: overall body size, adiposity, predisposition to abdominal fat deposition, and lean mass. Enrichment analyses suggest that body size and adiposity are affected by genes involved in neuronal signaling, whereas body fat distribution and lean mass are dependent on genes involved in morphogenesis and energy homeostasis. Using Mendelian randomization, we found that although both body size and adiposity contribute to the consequences of BMI, many of their effects are distinct, such as body size increasing the risk of diseases of the veins (b ≥ 0.044, p ≤ 8.9*10-10) and cardiac arrhythmia (b = 0.06, p = 4.2*10-17) while adiposity instead increased the risk of ischemic heart disease (b = 0.079, p = 8.2*10-21). The body mass-neutral component predisposing to abdominal fat deposition, likely reflecting a shift from subcutaneous to visceral fat, exhibited health effects that were weaker but specifically linked to lipotoxicity, such as ischemic heart disease (b = 0.067, p = 9.4*10-14) and diabetes (b = 0.082, p = 5.9*10-19). Combining their predicted effects significantly improved the prediction of obesity-related diseases, even when applied out-of-population (p {\&}lt; 10-10). The presented decomposition approach sheds light on the biological mechanisms underlying the remarkably heterogeneous nature of body morphology as well as its consequences on health and lifestyle.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis research has been conducted using the UK Biobank resource ({\#}16389).

OBJECTIVES: This review aims to provide an overview of systems biology approaches that are relevant to metabolomics and to discuss some successful applications of these methods. METHODS: We review the most recent applications of systems biology tools in the field of metabolomics, such as network inference and analysis, metabolic modelling and pathways analysis. RESULTS: We offer an ample overview of systems biology tools that can be applied to address metabolomics problems. The characteristics and application results of these tools are discussed also in a comparative manner.

We assessed BMI, waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), android-to-gynoid fat ratio (AGR), and BMI from childhood through adulthood. Linear regression with Bonferroni adjustment was performed to assess adiposity and metabolites. Of 233 metabolites, 168; 126; and 133 were associated with BMI, WHR, and AGR at age 60-64, respectively. Associations were strongest for HDL, particularly HDL particle size-e.g., there was 0.08 SD decrease in HDL diameter (95{\%} CI: 0.07-0.10) with each unit increase in BMI. BMI-adjusted AGR or WHR were associated with 31 metabolites where there was no metabolome-wide association with BMI. We identified inverse associations between BMI at age 7 and glucose or glycoprotein at age 60-64 and relatively large LDL cholesteryl ester with postadolescent BMI gains. In summary, we identified metabolomic correlates of central adiposity and earlier-life BMI. These findings support opportunities to leverage metabolomics in early prevention of cardiovascular risk attributable to body fatness.},

abstract = {Background: Body mass index (BMI) is a risk factor for endometrial cancer. We quantified the risk and investigated whether the association differed by use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT), menopausal status, and histologic type. Methods: We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE (1966 to December 2009) to identify prospective studies of BMI and incident endometrial cancer. We did random-effects meta-analyses, meta-regressions, and generalized least square regressions for trend estimations assuming linear, and piecewise linear, relationships. Results: Twenty-four studies (17,710 cases) were analyzed; 9 studies contributed to analyses by HRT, menopausal status, or histologic type, all published since 2003. In the linear model, the overall risk ratio (RR) per 5 kg/m2 increase in BMI was 1.60 (95{\%} CI, 1.52–1.68), P {\&}lt; 0.0001. In the piecewise model, RRs compared with a normal BMI were 1.22 (1.19–1.24), 2.09 (1.94–2.26), 4.36 (3.75–5.10), and 9.11 (7.26–11.51) for BMIs of 27, 32, 37, and 42 kg/m2, respectively. The association was stronger in never HRT users than in ever users: RRs were 1.90 (1.57–2.31) and 1.18 (95{\%} CI, 1.06–1.31) with P for interaction = 0.003. In the piecewise model, the RR in never users was 20.70 (8.28–51.84) at BMI 42 kg/m2, compared with never users at normal BMI. The association was not affected by menopausal status (P = 0.34) or histologic type (P = 0.26). Conclusions: HRT use modifies the BMI-endometrial cancer risk association. Impact: These findings support the hypothesis that hyperestrogenia is an important mechanism underlying the BMI-endometrial cancer association, whilst the presence of residual risk in HRT users points to the role of additional systems.

abstract = {This year marks the 20th anniversary of the discovery of leptin, which has tremendously stimulated translational obesity research. The discovery of leptin has led to realizations that have established adipose tissue as an endocrine organ, secreting bioactive molecules including hormones now termed adipokines. Through adipokines, the adipose tissue influences the regulation of several important physiological functions including but not limited to appetite, satiety, energy expenditure, activity, insulin sensitivity and secretion, glucose and lipid metabolism, fat distribution, endothelial function, hemostasis, blood pressure, neuroendocrine regulation, and function of the immune system. Adipokines have a great potential for clinical use as potential therapeutics for obesity, obesity related metabolic, cardiovascular and other diseases. After 20 years of intense research efforts, recombinant leptin and the leptin analog metreleptin are already available for the treatment of congenital leptin deficiency and lipodystrophy. Other adipokines are also emerging as promising candidates for urgently needed novel pharmacological treatment strategies not only in obesity but also other disease states associated with and influenced by adipose tissue size and activity. In addition, prediction of reduced type 2 diabetes risk by high circulating adiponectin concentrations suggests that adipokines have the potential to be used as biomarkers for individual treatment success and disease progression, to monitor clinical responses and to identify non-responders to anti-obesity interventions. With the growing number of adipokines there is an increasing need to define their function, molecular targets and translational potential for the treatment of obesity and other diseases. In this review we present research data on adipose tissue secreted hormones, the discovery of which followed the discovery of leptin 20 years ago pointing to future research directions to unravel mechanisms of action for adipokines.},

abstract = {Adipose tissue expands to accommodate increased lipid through hypertrophy of existing adipocytes and by initiating differentiation of preadipocytes. The capacity of adipose tissue to expand is critical for accommodating changes in energy availability, but this capacity is not an unlimited process and likely varies between individuals. We suggest that it is not the absolute amount of adipose tissue but rather the capacity of adipose tissue to expand that affects metabolic homeostasis. Here we highlight examples of disease states and transgenic animal models with altered adipose tissue function that support this hypothesis and discuss possible mechanisms by which altered adipose tissue expandability impairs metabolic homeostasisClinical observations and experiments using genetically modified mouse models, some of which are discussed here, demonstrate that our understanding of how adipose tissue affects metabolic homeostasis is still developing. Although we know that obesity is a major health concern that predisposes individuals to many secondary conditions, including insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, we suggest that it is not the absolute amount of adipose tissue that determines the metabolic disruption, but rather limited expansion capacity of the adipose tissue (Figure 1). Identifying adipose tissue expandability as an important factor in preventing lipotox-icity and associated metabolic complications may introduce new therapeutic approaches that promote adipose tissue storage capacity. Although this is a counterintuitive suggestion for the treatment of obesity-related diabetes, this would expand the safe storage depot for lipid and prevent the accumulation of toxic lipid species in non-adipose tissues.},

abstract = {During human fasting, metabolic markers, including butyrates, carnitines, and branched-chain amino acids, are upregulated for energy substitution through gluconeogenesis and use of stored lipids. We performed non-targeted, accurate semiquantitative metabolomic analysis of human whole blood, plasma, and red blood cells during 34–58 hr fasting of four volunteers. During this period, 44 of {\~{}}130 metabolites increased 1.5{\~{}}60-fold. Consistently fourteen were previously reported. However, we identified another 30 elevated metabolites, implicating hitherto unrecognized metabolic mechanisms induced by fasting. Metabolites in pentose phosphate pathway are abundant, probably due to demand for antioxidants, NADPH, gluconeogenesis and anabolic metabolism. Global increases of TCA cycle-related compounds reflect enhanced mitochondrial activity in tissues during fasting. Enhanced purine/pyrimidine metabolites support RNA/protein synthesis and transcriptional reprogramming, which is promoted also by some fasting-related metabolites, possibly via epigenetic modulations. Thus diverse, pronounced metabolite increases result from greatly activated catabolism and anabolism stimulated by fasting. Anti-oxidation may be a principal response to fasting.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Circulating C-reactive protein (CRP) is associated with the metabolic syndrome and might be causally linked to it. Our aim was to generate estimates of the association between plasma CRP and metabolic syndrome phenotypes that were free from confounding and reverse causation, to assess the causal role of this protein. METHODS: We examined associations between serum CRP concentration and metabolic syndrome phenotypes in the British Women's Heart and Health Study. We then compared these estimates with those derived from a mendelian randomised framework with common CRP gene haplotypes to generate unconfounded and unbiased estimates of any causal associations. FINDINGS: In a sample of British women, body-mass index (BMI), systolic blood pressure, waist-to-hip ratio, serum concentrations of HDL cholesterol and triglycerides, and insulin resistance were all associated with plasma CRP concentration. CRP haplotypes were associated with plasma CRP concentration (p{\textless}0.0001). With instrumental variable analyses, there was no association between plasma CRP concentration and any of the metabolic syndrome phenotypes analysed. There was strong evidence that linear regression and mendelian randomisation based estimation gave conflicting results for the CRP-BMI association (p=0.0002), and some evidence of conflicting results for the association of CRP with the score for insulin resistance (p=0.0139), triglycerides (p=0.0313), and HDL cholesterol (p=0.0688). INTERPRETATION: Disparity between estimates of the association between plasma CRP and phenotypes comprising the metabolic syndrome derived from conventional analyses and those from a mendelian randomisation approach suggests that there is no causal association between CRP and the metabolic syndrome phenotypes.},

The metabolic dysfunction, dyslipidaemia, and inflammation caused by obesity contribute to the development of a wide variety of disorders and effects on the nervous system. In the CNS, mild cognitive impairment can be attributed to obesity-induced alterations in hippocampal structure and function in some patients. Likewise, compromised hypothalamic function and subsequent defects in maintaining whole-body energy balance might be early events that contribute to weight gain and obesity development. In the peripheral nervous system, obesity-driven alterations in the autonomic nervous system prompt imbalances in sympathetic-parasympathetic activity, while alterations in the sensory-somatic nervous system underlie peripheral polyneuropathy, a common complication of diabetes. Pharmacotherapy and bariatric surgery are promising interventions for people with obesity that can improve neurological function. However, lifestyle interventions via dietary changes and exercise are the preferred approach to combat obesity and reduce its associated health risks.},

At any given BMI, East Asians have a greater amount of body fat and a tendency to visceral adiposity. In Asian patients, diabetes develops at a younger age and is characterized by early $\beta$ cell dysfunction in the setting of insulin resistance, with many requiring early insulin treatment. The increasing proportion of young-onset and childhood type 2 diabetes is posing a particular threat, with these patients being at increased risk of developing diabetic complications. East Asian patients with type 2 diabetes have a higher risk of developing renal complications than Europeans and, with regard to cardiovascular complications, a predisposition for developing strokes. In addition to cardiovascular-renal disease, cancer is emerging as the other main cause of mortality. While more research is needed to explain these interethnic differences, urgent and concerted actions are needed to raise awareness, facilitate early diagnosis, and encourage preventive strategies to combat these growing disease burdens.},

abstract = {The past decade has seen an enormous increase in the number of bariatric, or weight loss, operations performed. This trend is likely to continue, mirroring the epidemic of obesity around the world and its rising prevalence among children. Bariatric surgery is considered by many to be the most effective treatment for obesity in terms of maintenance of long-term weight loss and improvement in obesity-related comorbid conditions. Although overly simplified, the primary mechanisms of the surgical interventions currently utilized to treat obesity are the creation of a restrictive or malabsorptive bowel anatomy. Operations based on these mechanisms include the laparoscopic adjustable gastric band and laparoscopic vertical sleeve gastrectomy (considered primarily restrictive operations), the laparoscopic biliopancreatic diversion with or without a duodenal switch (primarily malabsorptive operation), and the laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (considered a combination restrictive and selective malabsorptive procedure). Each operation has pros and cons. Important considerations, for the patient and surgeon alike, in the decision to proceed with bariatric surgery include the technical aspects of the operation, postoperative complications including long-term nutritional problems, magnitude of initial and sustained weight loss desired, and correction of obesity-related comorbidities. Herein, the pros and cons of the contemporary laparoscopic bariatric operations are reviewed and ongoing controversies relating to bariatric surgery are discussed: appropriate patient selection, appropriate operation selection for an individual patient, surgeon selection, and how to measure success after surgery.},

abstract = {Psychopathology represents a leading cause of disability worldwide. Effective interventions need to target risk factors that are causally related to psychopathology. In order to distinguish between causal and spurious risk factors, it is critical to account for environmental and genetic confounding. Mendelian randomisation studies use genetic variants that are independent from environmental and genetic confounders in order to strengthen causal inference. We conducted a systematic review of studies (N = 19) using Mendelian randomisation to examine the causal role of putative risk factors for psychopathology-related outcomes including depression, anxiety, psychological distress, schizophrenia, substance abuse/antisocial behaviour, and smoking initiation. The most commonly examined risk factors in the reviewed Mendelian randomisation studies were smoking, alcohol use and body mass index. In most cases, risk factors were strongly associated with psychopathology-related outcomes in conventional analyses but Mendelian randomisation indicated that these associations were unlikely to be causal. However, Mendelian randomisation analyses showed that both smoking and homocysteine plasma levels may be causally linked with schizophrenia. We discuss possible reasons for these diverging results between conventional and Mendelian randomisation analyses and outline future directions for progressing research in ways that maximise the potential for identifying targets for intervention.},

The vast majority of these loci were found through large-scale meta-analyses for body mass index (BMI) and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), and in European ancestry populations. However, alternative approaches, focusing on non-European ancestry populations, more refined adiposity measures, and low-frequency (minor allele frequency (MAF){\textless}5{\%}) coding variants, identified additional novel loci that had not been identified before. Loci associated with overall obesity implicate pathways that act in the brain, whereas loci associated with fat distribution point to pathways involved in adipocyte biology. Pinpointing the causal gene within each locus remains challenging, but is a critical step towards translation of genome-wide association study (GWAS) loci into new biology. Ultimately, new genes may provide pharmacological targets for the development of weight loss drugs.},

abstract = {One of the reasons for the popularity of meta-analysis is the notion that these analyses will possess more power to detect effects than individual studies. This is inevitably the case under a fixed-effect model. However, the inclusion of the between-study variance in the random-effects model, and the need to estimate this parameter, can have unfortunate implications for this power. We develop methods for assessing the power of random-effects meta-analyses, and the average power of the individual studies that contribute to meta-analyses, so that these powers can be compared. In addition to deriving new analytical results and methods, we apply our methods to 1991 meta-analyses taken from the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews to retrospectively calculate their powers. We find that, in practice, 5 or more studies are needed to reasonably consistently achieve powers from random-effects meta-analyses that are greater than the studies that contribute to them. Not only is statistical inference under the random-effects model challenging when there are very few studies but also less worthwhile in such cases. The assumption that meta-analysis will result in an increase in power is challenged by our findings.},

During a mean of 21.4 years of follow-up, 12 356 deaths were identified. A J shaped association was consistently observed between BMI and all cause mortality. Multivariable adjusted Cox models including predicted fat mass and lean body mass showed a strong positive monotonic association between predicted fat mass and all cause mortality. Compared with those in the lowest fifth of predicted fat mass, men in the highest fifth had a hazard ratio of 1.35 (95{\%} confidence interval 1.26 to 1.46) for mortality from all causes. In contrast, a U shaped association was found between predicted lean body mass and all cause mortality. Compared with those in the lowest fifth of predicted lean body mass, men in the second to fourth fifths had 8-10{\%} lower risk of mortality from all causes. In the restricted cubic spline models, the risk of all cause mortality was relatively flat until 21 kg of predicted fat mass and increased rapidly afterwards, with a hazard ratio of 1.22 (1.18 to 1.26) per standard deviation. For predicted lean body mass, a large reduction of the risk was seen within the lower range until 56 kg, with a hazard ratio of 0.87 (0.82 to 0.92) per standard deviation, which increased thereafter (P for non-linearity {\&}lt;0.001). For cause specific mortality, men in the highest fifth of predicted fat mass had hazard ratios of 1.67 (1.47 to 1.89) for cardiovascular disease, 1.24 (1.09 to 1.43) for cancer, and 1.26 (0.97 to 1.64) for respiratory disease. On the other hand, a U shaped association was found between predicted lean body mass and mortality from cardiovascular disease and cancer. However, a strong inverse association existed between predicted lean body mass and mortality from respiratory disease (P for trend {\&}lt;0.001).Conclusions The shape of the association between BMI and mortality was determined by the relation between two body components (lean body mass and fat mass) and mortality. This finding suggests that the “obesity paradox” controversy may be largely explained by low lean body mass, rather than low fat mass, in the lower range of BMI.},

abstract = {Background Mendelian randomization is used to test and estimate the magnitude of a causal effect of a phenotype on an outcome by using genetic variants as instrumental variables (IVs). Estimates of association from IV analysis are biased in the direction of the confounded, observational association between phenotype and outcome. The magnitude of the bias depends on the F-statistic for the strength of relationship between IVs and phenotype. We seek to develop guidelines for the design and analysis of Mendelian randomization studies to minimize bias.Methods IV analysis was performed on simulated and real data to investigate the effect on bias of size of study, number and choice of instruments and method of analysis.Results Bias is shown to increase as the expected F-statistic decreases, and can be reduced by using parsimonious models of genetic association (i.e. not over-parameterized) and by adjusting for measured covariates. Using data from a single study, the causal estimate of a unit increase in log-transformed C-reactive protein on fibrinogen ($\mu$mol/l) is shown to increase from −0.005 (P = 0.99) to 0.792 (P = 0.00003) due to injudicious choice of instrument. Moreover, when the observed F-statistic is larger than expected in a particular study, the causal estimate is more biased towards the observational association and its standard error is smaller. This correlation between causal estimate and standard error introduces a second source of bias into meta-analysis of Mendelian randomization studies. Bias can be alleviated in meta-analyses by using individual level data and by pooling genetic effects across studies.Conclusions Weak instrument bias is of practical importance for the design and analysis of Mendelian randomization studies. Post hoc choice of instruments, genetic models or data based on measured F-statistics can exacerbate bias. In particular, the commonly cited rule of thumb that F {\textgreater} 10 avoids bias in IV analysis is misleading.},

abstract = {Recent genetic studies have identified some alleles that are associated with higher BMI but lower risk of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease. These "favorable adiposity" alleles are collectively associated with lower insulin levels and higher subcutaneous-to-visceral adipose tissue ratio and may protect from disease through higher adipose storage capacity. We aimed to use data from 164,609 individuals from the UK Biobank and five other studies to replicate associations between a genetic score of 11 favorable adiposity variants and adiposity and risk of disease, to test for interactions between BMI and favorable adiposity genetics, and to test effects separately in men and women. In the UK Biobank, the 50{\%} of individuals carrying the most favorable adiposity alleles had higher BMIs (0.120 kg/m(2) [95{\%} CI 0.066, 0.174]; P = 1E-5) and higher body fat percentage (0.301{\%} [0.230, 0.372]; P = 1E-16) compared with the 50{\%} of individuals carrying the fewest alleles. For a given BMI, the 50{\%} of individuals carrying the most favorable adiposity alleles were at lower risk of type 2 diabetes (odds ratio [OR] 0.837 [0.784, 0.894]; P = 1E-7), hypertension (OR 0.935 [0.911, 0.958]; P = 1E-7), and heart disease (OR 0.921 [0.872, 0.973]; P = 0.003) and had lower blood pressure (systolic -0.859 mmHg [-1.099, -0.618]; P = 3E-12 and diastolic -0.394 mmHg [-0.534, -0.254]; P = 4E-8). In women, these associations could be explained by the observation that the alleles associated with higher BMI but lower risk of disease were also associated with a favorable body fat distribution, with a lower waist-to-hip ratio (-0.004 cm [95{\%} CI -0.005, -0.003] 50{\%} vs. 50{\%}; P = 3E-14), but in men, the favorable adiposity alleles were associated with higher waist circumference (0.454 cm [0.267, 0.641] 50{\%} vs. 50{\%}; P = 2E-6) and higher waist-to-hip ratio (0.0013 [0.0003, 0.0024] 50{\%} vs. 50{\%}; P = 0.01). Results were strengthened when a meta-analysis with five additional studies was conducted. There was no evidence of interaction between a genetic score consisting of known BMI variants and the favorable adiposity genetic score. In conclusion, different molecular mechanisms that lead to higher body fat percentage (with greater subcutaneous storage capacity) can have different impacts on cardiometabolic disease risk. Although higher BMI is associated with higher risk of diseases, better fat storage capacity could reduce the risk.},

Methods We did a systematic search using PubMed and Scopus, from inception up to January 2017. Prospective cohort studies reporting the risk estimates of hypertension for three or more quantitative categories of indices of general and abdominal adiposity were included. Summary relative risks were calculated using random-effects models. Results Fifty-seven prospective cohort studies were included. Summary relative risks were 1.49 (95{\%} confidence interval [CI]: 1.41, 1.58; I2 = 97.4{\%}, n = 50) for a five-unit increment in body mass index, 1.27 (95{\%}CI: 1.15, 1.39; I2 = 95.0{\%}, n = 14) for a 10-cm increment in waist circumference, 1.16 (95{\%}CI: 1.09, 1.23; I2 = 77.8{\%}, n = 5) for weight gain equal to a one-unit increment in BMI, and 1.37 (95{\%}CI: 1.24, 1.51; I2 = 76.4{\%}, n = 8) and 1.74 (95{\%}CI: 1.35, 2.13; I2 = 58.9{\%}, n = 4) for a 0.1-unit increment in waist-to-hip ratio and waist-to-height ratio, respectively. The risk of hypertension increased continuously with increasing all anthropometric measures, and also along with weight gain.

abstract = {Mendelian randomization (MR) uses genetic data to probe questions of causality in epidemiological research, by invoking the Instrumental Variable (IV) assumptions. In recent years, it has become commonplace to attempt MR analyses by synthesising summary data estimates of genetic association gleaned from large and independent study populations. This is referred to as two-sample summary data MR. Unfortunately, due to the sheer number of variants that can be easily included into summary data MR analyses, it is increasingly likely that some do not meet the IV assumptions due to pleiotropy. There is a pressing need to develop methods that can both detect and correct for pleiotropy, in order to preserve the validity of the MR approach in this context. In this paper, we aim to clarify how established methods of meta-regression and random effects modelling from mainstream meta-analysis are being adapted to perform this task. Specifically, we focus on two contrastin g approaches: the Inverse Variance Weighted (IVW) method which assumes in its simplest form that all genetic variants are valid IVs, and the method of MR-Egger regression that allows all variants to violate the IV assumptions, albeit in a specific way. We investigate the ability of two popular random effects models to provide robustness to pleiotropy under the IVW approach, and propose statistics to quantify the relative goodness-of-fit of the IVW approach over MR-Egger regression. {\textcopyright} 2017 The Authors.

abstract = {Meta-analyses are typically used to estimate the overall/mean of an outcome of interest. However, inference about between-study variability, which is typically modelled using a between-study variance parameter, is usually an additional aim. The DerSimonian and Laird method, currently widely used by default to estimate the between-study variance, has been long challenged. Our aim is to identify known methods for estimation of the between-study variance and its corresponding uncertainty, and to summarise the simulation and empirical evidence that compares them. We identified 16 estimators for the between-study variance, seven methods to calculate confidence intervals, and several comparative studies. Simulation studies suggest that for both dichotomous and continuous data the estimator proposed by Paule and Mandel and for continuous data the restricted maximum likelihood estimator are better alternatives to estimate the between-study variance. Based on the scenarios and results presented in the published studies, we recommend the Q-profile method and the alternative approach based on a 'generalised Cochran between-study variance statistic' to compute corresponding confidence intervals around the resulting estimates. Our recommendations are based on a qualitative evaluation of the existing literature and expert consensus. Evidence-based recommendations require an extensive simulation study where all methods would be compared under the same scenarios.},

The effect of these instruments on breast cancer risk was evaluated using genetic data from the BCAC consortium based on 122,977 breast cancer cases and 105,974 controls.Exposures Genetically modified plasma levels of LDL, HDL, or TG.Main Outcomes and Measures Odds ratio (OR) for breast cancer risk per standard-deviation increase in HDL, LDL, or TG.Results We observed that a 1-SD genetically determined increase in HDL levels is associated with an increased risk for all breast cancers (HDL: OR=1.08, 95{\%} CI=1.04-1.13, P=7.4×10−5).Multivariable MR analysis, which adjusted for the effects of LDL, TG, body mass index, and age at menarche, corroborated this observation for HDL (OR=1.06, 95{\%} CI=1.03-1.10, P=4.9×10−4) and also a relationship between LDL and breast cancer risk (OR=1.03, 95{\%} CI=1.01-1.07, P=0.02). We did not observe a difference in these relationships when stratified by breast tumor estrogen receptor status. We repeated this analysis using genetic variants independent of the leading association at core HDL pathway genes and found that these variants were also associated with risk for breast cancers (OR=1.11, 95{\%} CI=1.06–1.16, P=1.5×10−6), including gene-specific associations at ABCA1, APOE-APOC1-APOC4-APOC2 and CETP. In addition, we find evidence that genetic variation at the ABO locus affects both lipid levels and breast cancer.Conclusions Genetically elevated plasma HDL levels appear to increase breast cancer risk. Future studies are required to understand the mechanism underlying this putative causal relationship, with the goal to develop potential therapeutic strategies aimed at altering the HDL-mediated effect on breast cancer risk.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although the rising pandemic of obesity has received major attention in  many countries, the effects of this attention on trends and the disease burden of obesity remain uncertain. METHODS: We analyzed data from 68.5 million persons to assess the trends in the prevalence of overweight and obesity among children and adults between 1980 and 2015. Using the Global Burden of Disease study data and methods, we also quantified the burden of disease related to high body-mass index (BMI), according to age, sex, cause, and BMI in 195 countries between 1990 and 2015. RESULTS: In 2015, a total of 107.7 million children and 603.7 million adults were obese. Since 1980, the prevalence of obesity has doubled in more than 70 countries and has continuously increased in most other countries. Although the prevalence of obesity among children has been lower than that among adults, the rate of increase in childhood obesity in many countries has been greater than the rate of increase in adult obesity. High BMI accounted for 4.0 million deaths globally, nearly 40{\%} of which occurred in persons who were not obese. More than two thirds of deaths related to high BMI were due to cardiovascular disease. The disease burden related to high BMI has increased since 1990; however, the rate of this increase has been attenuated owing to decreases in underlying rates of death from cardiovascular disease. CONCLUSIONS: The rapid increase in the prevalence and disease burden of elevated BMI highlights the need for continued focus on surveillance of BMI and identification, implementation, and evaluation of evidence-based interventions to address this problem.

Similar to other reporting guidelines such as CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) for randomised trials and STROBE (STrenghtening the Reporting of Observational studies in Epidemiology) for observational studies in epidemiology, the STROBE-MR working group aims to provide guidance to authors on how to improve reporting of MR studies and help readers, reviewers, and journal editors to evaluate the quality of the presented evidence. Empirical evidence indicates that many reports of MR studies do not clearly state or examine the various assumptions of MR methods and report insufficient details on the data sources, which makes it hard to evaluate the quality and reliability of the results.

At present, the draft checklist consists of 20 items, organized into the title and abstract, introduction, methods, results and discussion sections of articles. As these guidelines aim to reach the entire MR community, we would like to give everyone the opportunity to contribute their comments. The following draft of the STROBE-MR checklist is open for public discussion and all feedback will be taken into account during its next revision.

However, existing methods are computationally intractable in large cohorts and may not optimize power. All existing methods require time cost O(MN(2)) (where N is the number of samples and M is the number of SNPs) and implicitly assume an infinitesimal genetic architecture in which effect sizes are normally distributed, which can limit power. Here we present a far more efficient mixed-model association method, BOLT-LMM, which requires only a small number of O(MN) time iterations and increases power by modeling more realistic, non-infinitesimal genetic architectures via a Bayesian mixture prior on marker effect sizes. We applied BOLT-LMM to 9 quantitative traits in 23,294 samples from the Women's Genome Health Study (WGHS) and observed significant increases in power, consistent with simulations. Theory and simulations show that the boost in power increases with cohort size, making BOLT-LMM appealing for genome-wide association studies in large cohorts.},

A key challenge in data‐driven research is to discover unexpected patterns and to formulate hypotheses in an unbiased manner in vast amounts of genomic and other associated data. Over the past two decades, this has driven the development of numerous data visualization techniques and tools for visualizing genomic data. Based on a comprehensive literature survey, we propose taxonomies for data, visualization, and tasks involved in genomic data visualization.

abstract = {Leptin is a peptide hormone that is mainly, but not exclusively, produced in adipose tissue and plays a pivotal role in regulating food intake and energy expenditure. Besides its effects on regulation of body weight, appetite and energy expenditure, leptin exhibits influence on the immune system and may contribute to the deterioration of renal function. These direct and indirect renal effects of leptin could partly explain obesity-associated kidney disease and may be also relevant for diabetic nephropathy in type 2 diabetes. Leptin is primarily metabolized in the kidney, presumably by binding to megalin, a multiligand receptor in the proximal tubule, tubular uptake and endocytosis. The kidney expresses abundant concentrations of the small isoform of the leptin receptor (Ob-Ra). In cultured renal rat endothelial cells and mesangial cells obtained from db/db mice, leptin can signal through the Ob-Ra receptor isoform. The peptide stimulates proliferation of glomerular endothelial cells, increases TGF-Β1 synthesis, and collagen type IV production. In contrast, leptin did not influence TGF-Β1 production in mesangial cells, but the peptide stimulates glucose transport in these cells, increased collagen type I synthesis, and lead to an upregulation of surface TGF-Β type II receptors through signal transduction pathways involving phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase. Leptin also stimulates hypertrophy, but not proliferation in cultured rat mesangial cells. Infusion of leptin for 3 weeks into normal rats fosters development of glomerulosclerosis and proteinuria. In addition, transgenic mice with leptin overexpression demonstrated a increase in collagen type IV and fibronectin mRNA in the kidney. Additional previously described direct and indirect effects of leptin on the kidney include natriuretic effects, an increase in sympathetic nervous activity, and stimulation of reactive oxygen species. These findings collectively suggest that the kidney is a target organ for leptin and that this hormone might play an important role in renal pathophysiology.},

Two main measures of body shape and size were examined: i) body mass index (BMI) and ii) waist circumference (WC). Incident cancers were identified via linkage to the Alberta Cancer Registry. Cox proportional hazards models were used. Males and females classified as obese (BMI ≥ 30 kg /m−2) have a 33{\%} and 22{\%} increased risk of all-cancer, respectively, than their normal weight counterparts. Similar all-cancer risk increases are observed for those above sex-specific WC guidelines.

abstract = {The evidence for anthropometric factors influencing breast cancer risk is  accumulating, but uncertainties remain concerning the role of fat distribution and potential effect modifiers. We used data from 73,542 premenopausal and 103,344 postmenopausal women from 9 European countries, taking part in the EPIC study. RRs from Cox regression models were calculated, using measured height, weight, BMI and waist and hip circumferences; categorized by cohort-wide quintiles; and expressed as continuous variables, adjusted for study center, age and other risk factors. During 4.7 years of follow-up, 1,879 incident invasive breast cancers were identified. In postmenopausal women, current HRT modified the body size-breast cancer association. Among nonusers, weight, BMI and hip circumference were positively associated with breast cancer risk (all ptrend {\textless} or = 0.002); obese women (BMI {\textgreater} 30) had a 31{\%} excess risk compared to women with BMI {\textless} 25. Among HRT users, body measures were inversely but nonsignificantly associated with breast cancer. Excess breast cancer risk with HRT was particularly evident among lean women. Pooled RRs per height increment of 5 cm were 1.05 (95{\%} CI 1.00-1.16) in premenopausal and 1.10 (95{\%} CI 1.05-1.16) in postmenopausal women. Among premenopausal women, hip circumference was the only other measure significantly related to breast cancer (ptrend = 0.03), after accounting for BMI. In postmenopausal women not taking exogenous hormones, general obesity is a significant predictor of breast cancer, while abdominal fat assessed as waist-hip ratio or waist circumference was not related to excess risk when adjusted for BMI. Among premenopausal women, weight and BMI showed nonsignificant inverse associations with breast cancer.},

abstract = {Genomic data visualization is essential for interpretation and hypothesis generation as well as a valuable aid in communicating discoveries. Visual tools bridge the gap between algorithmic approaches and the cognitive skills of investigators. Addressing this need has become crucial in genomics, as biomedical research is increasingly data‐driven and many studies lack well‐defined hypotheses. A key challenge in data‐driven research is to discover unexpected patterns and to formulate hypotheses in an unbiased manner in vast amounts of genomic and other associated data. Over the past two decades, this has driven the development of numerous data visualization techniques and tools for visualizing genomic data. Based on a comprehensive literature survey, we propose taxonomies for data, visualization, and tasks involved in genomic data visualization. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive review of published genomic visualization tools in the context of the proposed taxonomies.},

As a model of an isolate population, we sequenced the genomes of 1463 Finnish individuals as part of the Sequencing Initiative Suomi (SISu) Project. We compared the genomic profiles of the 1463 Finns to a sample of 1463 British individuals that were sequenced in parallel as part of the UK10K Project. Whereas there were no major differences in the allele frequency of common variants, a significant depletion of variants in the rare frequency spectrum was observed in Finns when comparing the two populations. On the other hand, we observed {\textgreater}2.1 million variants that were twice as frequent among Finns compared with Britons and 800 000 variants that were more than 10 times more frequent in Finns. Furthermore, in Finns we observed a relative proportional enrichment of variants in the minor allele frequency range between 2 and 5{\%} (P{\textless}2.2 × 10−16). When stratified by their functional annotations, loss-of-function variants showed the highest proportional enrichment in Finns (P=0.0291). In the non-coding part of the genome, variants in conserved regions (P=0.002) and promoters (P=0.01) were also significantly enriched in the Finnish samples. These functional categories represent the highest a priori power for downstream association studies of rare variants using population isolates.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Metabolite levels within an individual vary over time. This within-individual variability, coupled with technical variability, reduces the power for epidemiologic studies to detect associations with disease. Here, the authors assess the variability of a large subset of metabolites and evaluate the implications for epidemiologic studies. METHODS: Using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) and gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC/MS) platforms, 385 metabolites were measured in 60 women at baseline and year-one of the Shanghai Physical Activity Study, and observed patterns were confirmed in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening study. RESULTS: Although the authors found high technical reliability (median intraclass correlation = 0.8), reliability over time within an individual was low. Taken together, variability in the assay and variability within the individual accounted for the majority of variability for 64{\%} of metabolites. Given this, a metabolite would need, on average, a relative risk of 3 (comparing upper and lower quartiles of "usual" levels) or 2 (comparing quartiles of observed levels) to be detected in 38{\%}, 74{\%}, and 97{\%} of studies including 500, 1,000, and 5,000 individuals. Age, gender, and fasting status factors, which are often of less interest in epidemiologic studies, were associated with 30{\%}, 67{\%}, and 34{\%} of metabolites, respectively, but the associations were weak and explained only a small proportion of the total metabolite variability. CONCLUSION: Metabolomics will require large, but feasible, sample sizes to detect the moderate effect sizes typical for epidemiologic studies. IMPACT: We offer guidelines for determining the sample sizes needed to conduct metabolomic studies in epidemiology.},

The study population was classified into four groups: (1) normal weight with normal {\%}BF, (2) normal weight with high {\%}BF, (3) overweight with normal {\%}BF and (4) overweight with high {\%}BF.Main outcome measures ORs for ABG including pre-diabetes and undiagnosed diabetes (HbA1c ≥5.7{\%}, ≥39 mmol/mol).Results 64{\%} of population with normal BMI classification had a high {\%}BF. Prevalence of ABG in normal-weight group with high {\%}BF (13.5{\%}) is significantly higher than the overweight group with low {\%}BF (10.5{\%}, P{\&}lt;0.001). In an unadjusted model, the OR of ABG was significantly greater in adults at normal BMI with high {\%}BF compared with individuals at normal weight with low {\%}BF. In an adjusted model controlling for age, sex, race/ethnicity, first-degree-relative diabetes, vigorous-intensity activities and muscle strengthening activities, risks of ABG were greater in population with normal weight and high {\%}BF (OR 1.55, 95{\%} CI 1.01 to 2.38) and with overweight and low {\%}BF (OR 1.17, 95{\%} CI 0.69 to 1.98, P{\&}lt;0.05).Conclusions Integrating BMI with {\%}BF can improve in classification to direct screening and prevention efforts to a group currently considered healthy and avoid penalties and stigmatisation of other groups that are classified as high risk of ABG.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Estimates of excess mortality associated with body mass index (BMI; in kg/m(2)) have been calculated for the US population. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this article is to compare the excess mortality associated with BMI levels to the excess mortality associated with other anthropometric variables. DESIGN: For the 1988-1994 Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, estimates of excess deaths were calculated for standard BMI levels and for comparable levels of percentage body fat, waist circumference, hip and arm circumferences, waist-hip ratio, the sum of 4 skinfold thicknesses, and waist-stature ratio. The outcome measure is the percentage of deaths in the full sample in excess of those predicted for the reference category. RESULTS: For the level equivalent to BMI {\textless}18.5, estimates of excess deaths ranged from 0.3{\%} for waist-hip ratio to 2.4{\%} for percentage body fat. All except waist circumference, waist-hip ratio, and waist-stature ratio were significantly greater than zero (P {\textless} 0.05). For the level equivalent to BMI 25 to {\textless}30, the percentage of excess deaths was 0.1{\%} for percentage body fat and negative for all other variables; estimates were significantly below zero only for circumferences and waist-stature ratio. For the level equivalent to BMI {\textgreater} or = 30, estimates ranged from -1.7{\%} for waist circumference to 1.5{\%} for percentage of fat; none were significantly different from zero. Estimates for all-cause mortality, obesity-related causes of death, and other causes of death showed no statistically significant or systematic differences between BMI and other variables. CONCLUSION: In this population-based study, attributable fractions of deaths were similar across measures.},

The aging brain provides a vulnerable environment to which a high fat diet could cause more damage. We investigated the effects of a high fat/high cholesterol (HFHC) diet on cognitive performance, neuroinflammation markers, and phosphorylated Tau (p-Tau) pathological markers in the hippocampus of Young (4-month old) versus Aged (14-month old) male rats. Young and Aged male Fisher 344 rats were fed a HFHC diet or a normal control diet for 6 months. All animals underwent cognitive testing for 12days in a water radial arm maze to assess spatial and working reference memory. Hippocampal tissue was analyzed by immunohistochemistry for structural changes and inflammation, and Western blot analysis. Young and Aged rats fed the HFHC diet exhibited worse performance on a spatial working memory task. They also exhibited significant reduction of NeuN and calbindin-D28k immunoreactivity as well as an increased activation of microglial cells in the hippocampal formation. Western blot analysis of the hippocampus showed higher levels of p-Tau S202/T205 and T231 in Aged HFHC rats, suggesting abnormal phosphorylation of Tau protein following the HFHC diet exposure. This work demonstrates HFHC diet-induced cognitive impairment with aging and a link between high fat diet consumption and pathological markers of Alzheimer's disease.},

Unfortunately, observational epidemiological studies are limited in their ability to reliably identify such causal associations, reflected in the many cases in which conventional epidemiological studies have apparently identified such associations that randomized controlled trials have failed to verify. The use of genetic variants as proxy measures of exposure ?an application of the Mendelian randomization principle?can contribute to strengthening causal inference. Genetic variants are not subject to bias due to reverse causation (disease processes influencing exposure, rather than vice versa) or recall bias, and if simple precautions are applied, they are not influenced by confounding or attenuation by errors. The principles of Mendelian randomization are illustrated with specific reference to studies of the effects of alcohol intake on various health-related outcomes through the utilization of genetic variants related to alcohol metabolism (in ALDH2 and ADH1B). Ways of incorporating Gene ? Environment interactions into the Mendelian randomization framework are developed, and the strengths and limitations of the approach discussed.},

abstract = {Objectives:? To determine the presence of traditional and emergent cardiovascular risk factors and to evaluate the triglyceride/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (Tg/HDL-C) ratio as a marker for cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome (MS) in obese children. Material and methods:? Sixty-seven prepubertal children of both sexes, between the ages of 6 and 12?yr, 20 normal-weight children, 18 overweight, and 29 obese subjects, were studied. Anthropometric measures, blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), and fat mass (FM), were measured. Plasma glucose, serum insulin, lipid profile, C-reactive protein (CRP), and leptin concentrations were quantified. Glucose and insulin concentrations 2?h post-glucose load were determined. The Tg/HDL-C ratio, homeostasis model assessment index (HOMA), and quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI) were calculated. Results:? Systolic, diastolic, and mean blood pressures (MBP), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), Tg/HDL-C, total cholesterol/HDL-C, LDL-C/HDL-C ratios, basal and 2?h postload insulin, CRP, and leptin were significantly higher and the QUICKI index were lower in the obese group. MBP, Tg/HDL-C ratio, HOMA, CRP, and leptin levels showed a positive and significant correlation and QUICKI a negative correlation with abdominal circumference, BMI, and FM. The Tg/HDL-C ratio correlated positively with MBP. The frequency of MS in the obese group was 69{\%}. While Tg/HDL-C ratio, CRP, and leptin were higher and the values of QUICKI were lower in subjects with MS, it was the Tg/HDL-C ratio and the BMI that significantly explained the MS. Conclusions:? Obesity increases the cardiovascular risk in childhood. The Tg/HDL-C ratio could be a useful index in identifying children at risk for dyslipidemia, hypertension, and MS.},

A key component to correcting for stratification in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) is accurately identifying and controlling for the underlying structure present in the sample. Meta-analysis across cohorts is increasingly important for achieving very large sample sizes, but comes with the major disadvantage that each individual cohort corrects for different population stratification. Here we demonstrate that correcting for structure against an external reference adds significant value to meta-analysis. We treat the UK Biobank as a collection of smaller studies, each of which is geographically localised. We provide software to standardize an external dataset against a reference, provide the UK Biobank principal component loadings for this purpose, and demonstrate the value of this with an analysis of the geographically sampled ALSPAC cohort.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

abstract = {Abstract Objective Bone turnover, which regulates bone mass, may exert metabolic consequences, particularly on markers of glucose metabolism and adiposity. To better understand these relationships, we examined cross-sectional associations between bone turnover markers (BTMs) and metabolic traits in a population with high bone mass (HBM, BMD Z-score ≥+3.2). Design ?-C-terminal telopeptide of type-I collagen (?-CTX), procollagen type-1 amino-terminal propeptide (P1NP) and osteocalcin were assessed by electrochemiluminescence immunoassays. Metabolic traits, including lipids and glycolysis-related metabolites, were measured using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Associations of BTMs with metabolic traits were assessed using generalized estimating equation linear regression, accounting for within-family correlation, adjusting for potential confounders (age, sex, height, weight, menopause, bisphosphonate and oral glucocorticoid use). Results A total of 198 adults with HBM had complete data, mean [SD] age 61.6 [13.7] years; 77{\%} were female. Of 23 summary metabolic traits, citrate was positively related to all BTMs: adjusted ??-CTX = 0.050 (95{\%} CI 0.024, 0.076), P = 1.71 ? 10?4, ?osteocalcin = 6.54 ? 10?4 (1.87 ? 10?4, 0.001), P = .006 and ?P1NP = 2.40 ? 10?4 (6.49 ? 10?5, 4.14 ? 10?4), P = .007 (? = increase in citrate (mmol/L) per 1 µg/L BTM increase). Inverse relationships of ?-CTX (? = ?0.276 [?0.434, ?0.118], P = 6.03 ? 10?4) and osteocalcin (?0.004 [?0.007, ?0.001], P = .020) with triglycerides were also identified. We explored the generalizability of these associations in 3664 perimenopausal women (age 47.9 [4.4] years) from a UK family cohort. We confirmed a positive, albeit lower magnitude, association between ?-CTX and citrate (adjusted ?women = 0.020 [0.013, 0.026], P = 1.95 ? 10?9) and an inverse association of similar magnitude between ?-CTX and triglycerides (? = ?0.354 [?0.471, ?0.237], P = 3.03 ? 10?9). Conclusions Bone resorption is positively related to circulating citrate and inversely related to triglycerides. Further studies are justified to determine whether plasma citrate or triglyceride concentrations are altered by factors known to modulate bone resorption, such as bisphosphonates.},

abstract = {Rationale: Obesity leads to increased ischemic heart disease (IHD) risk, but the risk is thought to be mediated through intermediate variables and may not be caused by increased weight per se. Objective: To test the hypothesis that the increased IHD risk because of obesity is mediated through lipoproteins, blood pressure, glucose, and C-reactive protein. Methods and Results: Approximately 90 000 participants from Copenhagen were included in a Mendelian randomization design with mediation analyses. Associations were examined using conventional measurements of body mass index and intermediate variables and using genetic variants associated with these. During ≤22 years of follow-up 13 945 participants developed IHD. The increased IHD risk caused by obesity was partly mediated through elevated levels of nonfasting remnant cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, through elevated blood pressure, and possibly also through elevated nonfasting glucose levels; however, reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and elevated C-reactive protein levels were not mediators in genetic analyses. The 3 intermediate variables that explained the highest excess risk of IHD from genetically determined obesity were low-density lipoprotein cholesterol with 8{\%}, systolic blood pressure with 7{\%}, and remnant cholesterol with 7{\%} excess risk of IHD. Corresponding observational excess risks using conventional body mass index were 21{\%}, 11{\%}, and 20{\%}, respectively. Conclusions: The increased IHD risk because of obesity was partly mediated through elevated levels of nonfasting remnant and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and through elevated blood pressure. Our results suggest that there may be benefit to gain by reducing levels of these risk factors in obese individuals not able to achieve sustained weight loss.},

The development of NASH leads to an increase in morbidity and mortality. While the first line of treatment is lifestyle modifications, including dietary changes and increased physical activity, there are no approved pharmacological treatment agents for NAFLD and NASH currently. Due to its complex pathophysiology, different pathways are under investigation for drug development with the focus on metabolic pathways, inflammation, and slowing or reversing fibrosis. There are several agents advancing in clinical trials, and promising results have been seen with drugs that affect hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis. This review will provide an overview on NAFLD and some of the mechanisms of disease that are being targeted with pharmacologic agents.},

abstract = {Background: Body mass index (BMI) is the most widely used measure to diagnose obesity. However, the accuracy of BMI in detecting excess body adiposity in the adult general population is largely unknown. Methods: A cross-sectional design of 13 601 subjects (age 20-79.9 years; 49{\%} men) from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Bioelectrical impedance analysis was used to estimate body fat percent (BF{\%}). We assessed the diagnostic performance of BMI using the World Health Organization reference standard for obesity of BF{\%}{\textgreater}25{\%} in men and {\textgreater}35{\%} in women. We tested the correlation between BMI and both BF{\%} and lean mass by sex and age groups adjusted for race. Results: BMI-defined obesity (≥30 kg m -2 ) was present in 19.1{\%} of men and 24.7{\%} of women, while BF{\%}-defined obesity was present in 43.9{\%} of men and 52.3{\%} of women. A BMI≥30 had a high specificity (men=95{\%}, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI), 94-96 and women=99{\%}, 95{\%} CI, 98-100), but a poor sensitivity (men=36{\%}, 95{\%} CI, 35-37 and women=49{\%}, 95{\%} CI, 48-50) to detect BF{\%}-defined obesity. The diagnostic performance of BMI diminished as age increased. In men, BMI had a better correlation with lean mass than with BF{\%}, while in women BMI correlated better with BF{\%} than with lean mass. However, in the intermediate range of BMI (25-29.9 kg m -2 ), BMI failed to discriminate between BF{\%} and lean mass in both sexes. Conclusions: The accuracy of BMI in diagnosing obesity is limited, particularly for individuals in the intermediate BMI ranges, in men and in the elderly. A BMI cutoff of≥30 kg m -2 has good specificity but misses more than half of people with excess fat. These results may help to explain the unexpected better survival in overweight/mild obese patients. {\textcopyright} 2008 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved.},

Quality of evidence assessed by GRADE criteria.Data sources Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and full texts in our trials' registry for data not evident in databases. Authors were contacted for unpublished data.Eligibility criteria for selecting studies RCTs of dietary interventions targeting weight loss, with or without exercise advice or programmes, for adults with obesity and follow-up ≥1 year.Results 54 RCTs with 30 206 participants were identified. All but one trial evaluated low fat, weight reducing diets. For the primary outcome, high quality evidence showed that weight loss interventions decrease all cause mortality (34 trials, 685 events; risk ratio 0.82, 95{\%} confidence interval 0.71 to 0.95), with six fewer deaths per 1000 participants (95{\%} confidence interval two to 10). For other primary outcomes moderate quality evidence showed an effect on cardiovascular mortality (eight trials, 134 events; risk ratio 0.93, 95{\%} confidence interval 0.67 to 1.31), and very low quality evidence showed an effect on cancer mortality (eight trials, 34 events; risk ratio 0.58, 95{\%} confidence interval 0.30 to 1.11).

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Genome-wide data provide a powerful tool for inferring patterns of  genetic variation and structure of human populations. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study, we analysed almost 250,000 SNPs from a total of 945 samples from Eastern and Western Finland, Sweden, Northern Germany and Great Britain complemented with HapMap data. Small but statistically significant differences were observed between the European populations (F(ST) = 0.0040, p{\textless}10(-4)), also between Eastern and Western Finland (F(ST) = 0.0032, p{\textless}10(-3)). The latter indicated the existence of a relatively strong autosomal substructure within the country, similar to that observed earlier with smaller numbers of markers. The Germans and British were less differentiated than the Swedes, Western Finns and especially the Eastern Finns who also showed other signs of genetic drift. This is likely caused by the later founding of the northern populations, together with subsequent founder and bottleneck effects, and a smaller population size. Furthermore, our data suggest a small eastern contribution among the Finns, consistent with the historical and linguistic background of the population. SIGNIFICANCE: Our results warn against a priori assumptions of homogeneity among Finns and other seemingly isolated populations. Thus, in association studies in such populations, additional caution for population structure may be necessary. Our results illustrate that population history is often important for patterns of genetic variation, and that the analysis of hundreds of thousands of SNPs provides high resolution also for population genetics.},

abstract = {Background: Anthropometric measures such as the body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference are widely used as convenient indices of adiposity, yet there are limitations in their estimates of body fat. We aimed to determine the prevalence of obesity using criteria based on the BMI and waist circumference, and to examine the relationship between the BMI and body fat. Methodology/Principal Findings: This population-based, cross-sectional study was conducted as part of the Geelong Osteoporosis Study. A random sample of 1,467 men and 1,076 women aged 20-96 years was assessed 2001-2008. Overweight and obesity were identified according to BMI (overweight 25.0-29.9 kg/m 2; obesity ≥30.0 kg/m 2) and waist circumference (overweight men 94.0-101.9 cm; women 80.0-87.9 cm; obesity men ≥102.0 cm, women ≥88.0 cm); body fat mass was assessed using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry; height and weight were measured and lifestyle factors documented by self-report. According to the BMI, 45.1{\%} (95{\%}CI 42.4-47.9) of men and 30.2{\%} (95{\%}CI 27.4-33.0) of women were overweight and a further 20.2{\%} (95{\%}CI 18.0-22.4) of men and 28.6{\%} (95{\%}CI 25.8-31.3) of women were obese. Using waist circumference, 27.5{\%} (95{\%}CI 25.1-30.0) of men and 23.3{\%} (95{\%}CI 20.8-25.9) of women were overweight, and 29.3{\%} (95{\%}CI 26.9-31.7) of men and 44.1{\%} (95{\%}CI 41.2-47.1) of women, obese. Both criteria indicate that approximately 60{\%} of the population exceeded recommended thresholds for healthy body habitus. There was no consistent pattern apparent between BMI and energy intake. Compared with women, BMI overestimated adiposity in men, whose excess weight was largely attributable to muscular body builds and greater bone mass. BMI also underestimated adiposity in the elderly. Regression models including gender, age and BMI explained 0.825 of the variance in percent body fat. Conclusions/Significance: As the BMI does not account for differences in body composition, we suggest that gender- and age-specific thresholds should be considered when the BMI is used to indicate adiposity. {\textcopyright} 2012 Pasco et al.},

abstract = {To identify biomarkers of body mass index, body fat, trunk fat, and appendicular lean mass, nontargeted metabolomics was performed in plasma from 319 black men in the Health, Aging and Body Composition study (median age 72 years, median body mass index 26.8 kg/m2). Body mass index was calculated from measured height and weight; percent fat, percent trunk fat, and appendicular lean mass were measured with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Pearson partial correlations between body composition measures and metabolites were adjusted for age, study site, and smoking. Out of 350 metabolites, body mass index, percent fat, percent trunk fat, and appendicular lean mass were significantly correlated with 92, 48, 96, and 43 metabolites at p less than .0014. Metabolites most strongly correlated with body composition included carnitine, a marker of fatty acid oxidation (positively correlated), triacylglycerols (positively correlated), and amino acids including branched-chain amino acids (positively correlated except for acetylglycine and serine). Gaussian Graphical Models of metabolites found that 25 lipid metabolites clustered into a single network. Groups of five amino acids, three plasmalogens, and two carnitines were also observed. Findings confirm prior reports of associations between amino acids, lean mass, and fat mass in addition to associations not previously reported. Future studies should consider whether these metabolites are relevant for metabolic disease processes.},

The field of cancer metabolism subsequently revealed additional metabolic alterations in cancer by focusing on central carbon metabolism, including the citric acid cycle and pentose phosphate pathway. Recent reports have, however, uncovered substantial non-carbon metabolism contributions to cancer cell viability and growth. Amino acids, nutrients vital to the survival of all cell types, experience reprogrammed metabolism in cancer. This review outlines the diverse roles of amino acids within the tumor and in the tumor microenvironment. Beyond their role in biosynthesis, they serve as energy sources and help maintain redox balance. In addition, amino acid derivatives contribute to epigenetic regulation and immune responses linked to tumorigenesis and metastasis. Furthermore, in discussing the transporters and transaminases that mediate amino acid uptake and synthesis, we identify potential metabolic liabilities as targets for therapeutic intervention.},

OBJECTIVE: We investigated the association of BMI (in kg/m(2)), waist circumference, and waist-hip ratio (WHR) with mortality and cause-specific mortality. DESIGN: Subjects aged {\textgreater}/=75 y (n = 14 833) from 53 family practices in the United Kingdom underwent a health assessment that included measurement of BMI and waist and hip circumferences; they also were followed up for mortality. RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 5.9 y, 6649 subjects died (46{\%} of circulatory causes). In nonsmoking men and women (90{\%} of the cohort), compared with the lowest quintile of BMI ({\textless}23 in men and {\textless}22.3 in women), adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for mortality were {\textless}1 for all other quintiles of BMI (P for trend = 0.0003 and 0.0001 in men and women, respectively). Increasing WHR was associated with increasing HRs in men and women (P for trend = 0.008 and 0.0002, respectively). BMI was not associated with circulatory mortality in men (P for trend = 0.667) and was negatively associated in women (P for trend = 0.004). WHR was positively related to circulatory mortality in both men and women (P for trend = 0.001 and 0.005, respectively). Waist circumference was not associated with all-cause or circulatory mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Current guidelines for BMI-based risk categories overestimate risks due to excess weight in persons aged {\textgreater}/=75 y. Increased mortality risk is more clearly indicated for relative abdominal obesity as measured by high WHR.},

abstract = {Over the past decade, evidences of an integration of metabolic and inflammatory pathways, referred to as metaflammation in several aspects of metabolic syndrome, have been accumulating. Fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4), also known as adipocyte FABP (A-FABP) or aP2, is mainly expressed in adipocytes and macrophages and plays an important role in the development of insulin resistance and atherosclerosis in relation to metaflammation. Despite lack of a typical secretory signal peptide, FABP4 has been shown to be released from adipocytes in a non-classical pathway associated with lipolysis, possibly acting as an adipokine. Elevation of circulating FABP4 levels is associated with obesity, insulin resistance, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cardiac dysfunction, atherosclerosis, and cardiovascular events. Furthermore, ectopic expression and function of FABP4 in several types of cells and tissues have been recently demonstrated. Here, we discuss both the significant role of FABP4 in pathophysiological insights and its usefulness as a biomarker of metabolic and cardiovascular diseases.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To review progress in understanding the methods and results concerning the causal contribution of body mass index (BMI) to health and disease. METHODS: In the context of conventional evidence focused on the relationship between BMI and health, this review considers current literature on the common, population-based, genetic contribution to BMI and how this has fed into the developing field of applied epidemiology. RESULTS: Technological and analytical developments have driven considerable success in identifying genetic variants relevant to BMI. This has enabled the implementation of Mendelian randomization to address questions of causality. The product of this work has been the implication of BMI as a causal agent in a host of health outcomes. Further breakdown of causal pathways by integration with other "omics" technologies promises to deliver additional benefit. CONCLUSIONS: Gaps remain in our understanding of BMI as a risk factor for health and disease, and while promising, applied genetic epidemiology should be considered alongside alternative methods for assessing the impact of BMI on health. Potential limitations, relating to inappropriate or nonspecific measures of obesity and the improper use of genetic instruments, will need to be explored and incorporated into future research aiming to dissect BMI as a risk factor.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Youth with high BMI who become nonobese adults have the same cardiovascular risk factor burden as those who were never obese. However, the early-life BMI trajectories for overweight or obese youth who avoid becoming obese adults have not been described. We aimed to determine and compare the young-childhood BMI trajectories of participants according to their BMI status in youth and adulthood.METHODS: Bayesian hierarchical piecewise regression modeling was used to analyze the BMI trajectories of 2717 young adults who had up to 8 measures of BMI from childhood (ages 3–18 years) to adulthood (ages 34–49 years).RESULTS: Compared with those with persistently high BMI, those who resolved their high youth BMI by adulthood had lower average BMI at age 6 years and slower rates of BMI change from young childhood. In addition, their BMI levels started to plateau at 16 years old for females and 21 years old for males, whereas the BMI of those whose high BMI persisted did not stabilize until 25 years old for male subjects and 27 years for female subjects. Compared with those youth who were not overweight or obese and who remained nonobese in adulthood, those who developed obesity had a higher BMI rate of change from 6 years old, and their BMI continued to increase linearly until age 30 years.CONCLUSIONS: Efforts to alter BMI trajectories for adult obesity should ideally commence before age 6 years. The natural resolution of high BMI starts in adolescence for males and early adulthood for females, suggesting a critical window for secondary prevention.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: To date, the scientific literature on socioeconomic correlates and determinants of physical activity behaviours has been dispersed throughout a number of systematic reviews, often focusing on one factor (e.g. education or parental income) in one specific age group (e.g. pre-school children or adults). The aim of this umbrella review is to provide a comprehensive and systematic overview of the scientific literature from previously conducted research by summarising and synthesising the importance and strength of the evidence related to socioeconomic correlates and determinants of PA behaviours across the life course. METHODS: Medline, Embase, ISI Web of Science, Scopus and SPORTDiscus were searched for systematic literature reviews and meta-analyses of observational studies investigating the association between socioeconomic determinants of PA and PA itself (from January 2004 to September 2017). Data extraction evaluated the importance of determinants, strength of evidence, and methodological quality of the selected papers. The full protocol is available from PROSPERO (PROSPERO2014:CRD42015010616). RESULTS: Nineteen reviews were included. Moderate methodological quality emerged. For adults, convincing evidence supports a relationship between PA and socioeconomic status (SES), especially in relation to leisure time (positive relationship) and occupational PA (negative relationship). Conversely, no association between PA and SES or parental SES was found for pre-school, school-aged children and adolescents. CONCLUSIONS: Available evidence on the socioeconomic determinants of PA behaviour across the life course is probable (shows fairly consistent associations) at best. While some evidence is available for adults, less was available for youth. This is mainly due to a limited quantity of primary studies, weak research designs and lack of accuracy in the PA and SES assessment methods employed. Further PA domain specific studies using longitudinal design and clear measures of SES and PA assessment are required.},

Here we report that unlike inflammation in peripheral tissues, which develops as a consequence of obesity, hypothalamic inflammatory signaling was evident in both rats and mice within 1 to 3 days of HFD onset, prior to substantial weight gain. Furthermore, both reactive gliosis and markers suggestive of neuron injury were evident in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus of rats and mice within the first week of HFD feeding. Although these responses temporarily subsided, suggesting that neuroprotective mechanisms may initially limit the damage, with continued HFD feeding, inflammation and gliosis returned permanently to the mediobasal hypothalamus. Consistent with these data in rodents, we found evidence of increased gliosis in the mediobasal hypothalamus of obese humans, as assessed by MRI. These findings collectively suggest that, in both humans and rodent models, obesity is associated with neuronal injury in a brain area crucial for body weight control.},

abstract = {Increasing obesity is a major global health concern while at the same time iron-deficiency anemia remains common worldwide. Although these two conditions represent opposite ends of the spectrum of over- and under-nutrition, they appear to be linked: overweight individuals are at higher risk of iron deficiency than normal-weight individuals. Potential explanations for this association include dilutional hypoferremia, poor dietary iron intake, increased iron requirements, and/or impaired iron absorption in obese individuals. Recent evidence suggests obesity-related inflammation may play a central role through its regulation of hepcidin. Hepcidin levels are higher in obese individuals and are linked to subclinical inflammation; this may reduce iron absorption and blunt the effects of iron fortification. Thus, low iron status in overweight individuals may result from a combination of nutritional (reduced absorption) and functional (increased sequestration) iron deficiency. In this review, we focus on subclinical inflammation in obesity, and its effect on hepcidin levels, as the most plausible explanation for the link between iron deficiency and obesity.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In 2010, overweight and obesity were estimated to cause 3{\textperiodcentered}4 million deaths, 3{\textperiodcentered}9{\%} of years of life lost, and 3{\textperiodcentered}8{\%} of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) worldwide. The rise in obesity has led to widespread calls for regular monitoring of changes in overweight and obesity prevalence in all populations. Comparable, up-to-date information about levels and trends is essential to quantify population health effects and to prompt decision makers to prioritise action. We estimate the global, regional, and national prevalence of overweight and obesity in children and adults during 1980-2013. METHODS: We systematically identified surveys, reports, and published studies (n=1769) that included data for height and weight, both through physical measurements and self-reports. We used mixed effects linear regression to correct for bias in self-reports. We obtained data for prevalence of obesity and overweight by age, sex, country, and year (n=19,244) with a spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression model to estimate prevalence with 95{\%} uncertainty intervals (UIs). FINDINGS: Worldwide, the proportion of adults with a body-mass index (BMI) of 25 kg/m(2) or greater increased between 1980 and 2013 from 28{\textperiodcentered}8{\%} (95{\%} UI 28{\textperiodcentered}4-29{\textperiodcentered}3) to 36{\textperiodcentered}9{\%} (36{\textperiodcentered}3-37{\textperiodcentered}4) in men, and from 29{\textperiodcentered}8{\%} (29{\textperiodcentered}3-30{\textperiodcentered}2) to 38{\textperiodcentered}0{\%} (37{\textperiodcentered}5-38{\textperiodcentered}5) in women. Prevalence has increased substantially in children and adolescents in developed countries; 23{\textperiodcentered}8{\%} (22{\textperiodcentered}9-24{\textperiodcentered}7) of boys and 22{\textperiodcentered}6{\%} (21{\textperiodcentered}7-23{\textperiodcentered}6) of girls were overweight or obese in 2013. The prevalence of overweight and obesity has also increased in children and adolescents in developing countries, from 8{\textperiodcentered}1{\%} (7{\textperiodcentered}7-8{\textperiodcentered}6) to 12{\textperiodcentered}9{\%} (12{\textperiodcentered}3-13{\textperiodcentered}5) in 2013 for boys and from 8{\textperiodcentered}4{\%} (8{\textperiodcentered}1-8{\textperiodcentered}8) to 13{\textperiodcentered}4{\%} (13{\textperiodcentered}0-13{\textperiodcentered}9) in girls. In adults, estimated prevalence of obesity exceeded 50{\%} in men in Tonga and in women in Kuwait, Kiribati, Federated States of Micronesia, Libya, Qatar, Tonga, and Samoa. Since 2006, the increase in adult obesity in developed countries has slowed down. INTERPRETATION: Because of the established health risks and substantial increases in prevalence, obesity has become a major global health challenge. Not only is obesity increasing, but no national success stories have been reported in the past 33 years. Urgent global action and leadership is needed to help countries to more effectively intervene.

abstract = {Background The causal impact of excess adiposity on systemic metabolism is unclear. We used multivariable Mendelian randomization to compare the direct effects of total adiposity (using body mass index (BMI)) and abdominal adiposity (using waist-to-hip-ratio (WHR)) on circulating lipoproteins, lipids, and metabolites with a five-fold increase in sample size over previous studies.Methods We used new metabolic data on 109,532 UK Biobank participants. BMI and WHR were measured in 2006-2010, during which EDTA plasma was collected. Plasma samples were used in 2019-2020 to quantify 249 metabolic traits with high-throughput nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy including subclass-specific lipoprotein concentrations, apolipoprotein B, cholesterol and triglycerides, plus pre-glycemic and inflammatory metabolites. We used two-stage least squares regression models with genetic risk scores for BMI and WHR as instruments to estimate the total (unadjusted) and direct (mutually adjusted) effects of BMI and WHR on metabolic traits. We also estimated the effects of BMI and WHR on statin use, and examined interaction of main effects by sex, statin use, and age as a proxy for medication use.Results Higher BMI (per standard deviation (SD) or 4.8 kg/m2) was estimated to moderately decrease apolipoprotein B and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol before and after adjustment for WHR, whilst higher BMI increased triglycerides before but not after WHR adjustment. Estimated effects of higher WHR (per SD, or 0.090 ratio-unit) on lipoproteins, lipids, and metabolites were often larger than those of BMI, but null for LDL cholesterol, and attenuations were minimal upon adjustment for BMI. Patterns of effect estimates differed by sex, e.g., only BMI independently increased triglycerides among men, whereas only WHR independently increased triglycerides among women. Higher BMI and WHR (per SD) were each estimated to directly increase the relative odds of using statins (by 3.49 (95{\%} CI = 3.42, 3.57) times higher for WHR). These patterns were most pronounced among women, and there was strong evidence that the effects of BMI and WHR on metabolic traits differed by statin use and age. Among the youngest adults (38-53 years, statin use 5{\%}), higher BMI and WHR (per SD) each modestly increased LDL cholesterol (0.04 SD, 95{\%} CI = -0.01, 0.08 for total effect of BMI and 0.10 SD, 95{\%} CI = 0.02, 0.17 for total effect of WHR). This estimate for BMI fully attenuated, and the estimate for WHR remained unchanged, upon mutual adjustment. These direct effects on LDL cholesterol were more inverse for BMI and less positive for WHR at intermediate ages (54-62 years, statins 17{\%}) and older ages (63-73 years, statins 29{\%}) where the mutually adjusted effects of BMI and WHR on LDL cholesterol had reversed to -0.19 SD (95{\%} CI = -0.27, -0.11) and -0.05 SD (95{\%} CI = -0.16, 0.06), respectively.Conclusions Our results suggest that abdominal adiposity has a dominant role in driving the metabolic harms of excess adiposity, particularly among women. Our findings also suggest that apparent effects of adiposity on lowering LDL cholesterol are explained by an effect of adiposity on statin use.Competing Interest StatementMVH has collaborated with Boehringer Ingelheim in research, and in adherence to the University of Oxford{\&}{\#}039;s Clinical Trial Service Unit and Epidemiological Studies Unit (CSTU) staff policy, did not accept personal honoraria or other payments from pharmaceutical companies.

abstract = {The worldwide epidemic of obesity and type 2 diabetes has greatly increased interest in the biology and physiology of adipose tissues. Adipose (fat) cells are specialized for the storage of energy in the form of triglycerides, but research in the last few decades has shown that fat cells also play a critical role in sensing and responding to changes in systemic energy balance. White fat cells secrete important hormone-like molecules such as leptin, adiponectin, and adipsin to influence processes such as food intake, insulin sensitivity, and insulin secretion. Brown fat, on the other hand, dissipates chemical energy in the form of heat, thereby defending against hypothermia, obesity, and diabetes. It is now appreciated that there are two distinct types of thermogenic fat cells, termed brown and beige adipocytes. In addition to these distinct properties of fat cells, adipocytes exist within adipose tissue, where they are in dynamic communication with immune cells and closely influenced by innervation and blood supply. This review is intended to serve as an introduction to adipose cell biology and to familiarize the reader with how these cell types play a role in metabolic disease and, perhaps, as targets for therapeutic development.},

abstract = {Abstract Objective: The Tanita TBF-305 body fat analyzer is marketed for home and clinical use and is based on the principles of leg-to-leg bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). Few studies have investigated the ability of leg-to-leg BIA to detect change in percentage fat mass ({\%}FM) over time. Our objective was to determine the ability of leg-to-leg BIA vs. the four-compartment (4C) model to detect small changes in {\%}FM in overweight adults. Research Methods and Procedures: Thirty-eight overweight adults (BMI, 25.0 to 29.9 kg/m2; age, 18 to 44 years; 31 women) participated in a 6-month, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of a nutritional supplement. Body composition was measured at 0 and 6 months using the Tanita TBF-305 body fat analyzer [using equations derived by the manufacturer ({\%}FMT-Man) and by Jebb et al. ({\%}FMT-Jebb)] and the 4C model ({\%}FM4C). Results: Subjects in the experimental group lost 0.9{\%}FM4C (p = 0.03), a loss that did not reach significance using leg-to-leg BIA (0.6{\%}FMT-Man, p = 0.151; 0.6{\%}FMT-Jebb, p = 0.144). We observed large standard deviations (SDs) in the mean difference in {\%}FM between the 4C model and the TanitaManufacturer (2.5{\%}) and TanitaJebb (2.2{\%}). Ten subjects fell outside ±1 SD of the mean differences at 0 and 6 months; those individuals were younger and shorter than those within ±1 SD. Discussion: Leg-to-leg BIA performed reasonably well in predicting decreases in {\%}FM in this group of overweight adults but resulted in wide SDs vs. {\%}FM4C in individuals. Cross-sectional determinations of {\%}FM of overweight individuals using leg-to-leg BIA should be interpreted with caution.},

abstract = {The Human Metabolome Database or HMDB (www.hmdb.ca) is a web-enabled metabolomic database containing comprehensive information about human metabolites along with their biological roles, physiological concentrations, disease associations, chemical reactions, metabolic pathways, and reference spectra. First described in 2007, the HMDB is now considered the standard metabolomic resource for human metabolic studies. Over the past decade the HMDB has continued to grow and evolve in response to emerging needs for metabolomics researchers and continuing changes in web standards. This year's update, HMDB 4.0, represents the most significant upgrade to the database in its history. For instance, the number of fully annotated metabolites has increased by nearly threefold, the number of experimental spectra has grown by almost fourfold and the number of illustrated metabolic pathways has grown by a factor of almost 60. Significant improvements have also been made to the HMDB's chemical taxonomy, chemical ontology, spectral viewing, and spectral/text searching tools. A great deal of brand new data has also been added to HMDB 4.0. This includes large quantities of predicted MS/MS and GC-MS reference spectral data as well as predicted (physiologically feasible) metabolite structures to facilitate novel metabolite identification. Additional information on metabolite-SNP interactions and the influence of drugs on metabolite levels (pharmacometabolomics) has also been added. Many other important improvements in the content, the interface, and the performance of the HMDB website have been made and these should greatly enhance its ease of use and its potential applications in nutrition, biochemistry, clinical chemistry, clinical genetics, medicine, and metabolomics science.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), and the waist-stature ratio (WSR) are considered to be possible proxies for adiposity. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to investigate the relations between BMI, WC, WSR, and percentage body fat (measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) in adults in a large nationally representative US population sample from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). DESIGN: BMI, WC, and WSR were compared with percentage body fat in a sample of 12,901 adults. RESULTS: WC, WSR, and BMI were significantly more correlated with each other than with percentage body fat (P {\textless} 0.0001 for all sex-age groups). Percentage body fat tended to be significantly more correlated with WC than with BMI in men but significantly more correlated with BMI than with WC in women (P {\textless} 0.0001 except in the oldest age group). WSR tended to be slightly more correlated with percentage body fat than was WC. Percentile values of BMI, WC, and WSR are shown that correspond to percentiles of percentage body fat increments of 5 percentage points. More than 90{\%} of the sample could be categorized to within one category of percentage body fat by each measure. CONCLUSIONS: BMI, WC, and WSR perform similarly as indicators of body fatness and are more closely related to each other than with percentage body fat. These variables may be an inaccurate measure of percentage body fat for an individual, but they correspond fairly well overall with percentage body fat within sex-age groups and distinguish categories of percentage body fat.},

abstract = {A wealth of clinical and epidemiological evidence has linked obesity to a broad spectrum of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) including coronary heart disease, heart failure, hypertension, stroke, atrial fibrillation and sudden cardiac death. Obesity can increase CVD morbidity and mortality directly and indirectly. Direct effects are mediated by obesity-induced structural and functional adaptations of the cardiovascular system to accommodate excess body weight, as well as by adipokine effects on inflammation and vascular homeostasis. Indirect effects are mediated by co-existing CVD risk factors such as insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, hypertension and dyslipidemia. Adipose tissue (AT) quality and functionality are more relevant aspects for cardiometabolic risk than its total amount. The consequences of maladaptive AT expansion in obesity are local and systemic: the local include inflammation, hypoxia, dysregulated adipokine secretion and impaired mitochondrial function; the systemic comprise insulin resistance, abnormal glucose/lipid metabolism, hypertension, a pro-inflammatory and pro-thrombotic state and endothelial dysfunction, all of which provide linking mechanisms for the association between obesity and CVD. The present narrative review summarizes the major pathophysiological links between obesity and CVD (traditional and novel concepts), analyses the heterogeneity of obesity-related cardiometabolic consequences, and provides an overview of the cardiovascular impact of weight loss interventions.},

abstract = {Genomic analysis of longevity offers the potential to illuminate the biology of human aging. Here, using genome-wide association meta-analysis of 606,059 parents' survival, we discover two regions associated with longevity (HLA-DQA1/DRB1 and LPA). We also validate previous suggestions that APOE, CHRNA3/5, CDKN2A/B, SH2B3 and FOXO3A influence longevity. Next we show that giving up smoking, educational attainment, openness to new experience and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels are most positively genetically correlated with lifespan while susceptibility to coronary artery disease (CAD), cigarettes smoked per day, lung cancer, insulin resistance and body fat are most negatively correlated. We suggest that the effect of education on lifespan is principally mediated through smoking while the effect of obesity appears to act via CAD. Using instrumental variables, we suggest that an increase of one body mass index unit reduces lifespan by 7 months while 1 year of education adds 11 months to expected lifespan.Variability in human longevity is genetically influenced. Using genetic data of parental lifespan, the authors identify associations at HLA-DQA/DRB1 and LPA and find that genetic variants that increase educational attainment have a positive effect on lifespan whereas increasing BMI negatively affects lifespan.},

abstract = {Adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) has been discovered 14 years ago and revised our view on intracellular triglyceride (TG) mobilization – a process termed lipolysis. ATGL initiates the hydrolysis of TGs to release fatty acids (FAs) that are crucial energy substrates, precursors for the synthesis of membrane lipids, and ligands of nuclear receptors. Thus, ATGL is a key enzyme in whole-body energy homeostasis. In this review, we give an update on how ATGL is regulated on the transcriptional and post-transcriptional level and how this affects the enzymes' activity in the context of neutral lipid catabolism. In depth, we highlight and discuss the numerous physiological functions of ATGL in lipid and energy metabolism. Over more than a decade, different genetic mouse models lacking or overexpressing ATGL in a cell- or tissue-specific manner have been generated and characterized. Moreover, pharmacological studies became available due to the development of a specific murine ATGL inhibitor (Atglistatin{\textregistered}). The identification of patients with mutations in the human gene encoding ATGL and their disease spectrum has underpinned the importance of ATGL in humans. Together, mouse models and human data have advanced our understanding of the physiological role of ATGL in lipid and energy metabolism in adipose and non-adipose tissues, and of the pathophysiological consequences of ATGL dysfunction in mice and men.},

abstract = {Adiposity has been associated with the risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) in observational studies, but their association may differ according to specific characteristics of studies. In Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses, genetic variants are used as instrumental variables (IVs) of exposures to examine causal effects to overcome confounding factors and reverse causation. We performed MR analyses for adiposity (n = 322,154) on risk of CAD (60,801 cases and 123,504 controls) based on the currently largest genome-wide association studies. The estimated associations between adiposity traits and CAD were calculated by an inverse-variance weighted method with and without excluding the IVs, which are associated with the well-known risk factors of CAD. Genetic variants are identified to be associated with the well-known risk factors of CAD by a cross-phenotype meta-analysis method. Our results furnished strong evidence for a causal role of adiposity in risk of CAD, with the odds ratios (ORs) for CAD being 1.53 (95{\%} CI 1.36–1.72) for body mass index (BMI), 1.48 (1.20–1.96) for waist–hip ratio (WHR), and 1.34 (1.07–1.59) for WHR adjusted for BMI (WHRadjBMI), respectively. After excluding mediators-associated IVs from the MR analyses, the corresponding ORs were 1.46 (1.28–1.67) for BMI, 1.39 (1.01–1.93) for WHR, and 1.38 (1.04–1.84) for WHRadjBMI, respectively. Furthermore, our results suggested that central adiposity and general adiposity might pose a similar risk for CAD. In summary, our data supported that genetically driven adiposity traits imposed the risk of CAD independent of blood pressure, dyslipidaemia, glycaemic traits, and type 2 diabetes.},

abstract = {Associations between modifiable exposures and disease seen in observational epidemiology are sometimes confounded and thus misleading, despite our best efforts to improve the design and analysis of studies. Mendelian randomization—the random assortment of genes from parents to offspring that occurs during gamete formation and conception—provides one method for assessing the causal nature of some environmental exposures. The association between a disease and a polymorphism that mimics the biological link between a proposed exposure and disease is not generally susceptible to the reverse causation or confounding that may distort interpretations of conventional observational studies. Several examples where the phenotypic effects of polymorphisms are well documented provide encouraging evidence of the explanatory power of Mendelian randomization and are described. The limitations of the approach include confounding by polymorphisms in linkage disequilibrium with the polymorphism under study, that polymorphisms may have several phenotypic effects associated with disease, the lack of suitable polymorphisms for studying modifiable exposures of interest, and canalization—the buffering of the effects of genetic variation during development. Nevertheless, Mendelian randomization provides new opportunities to test causality and demonstrates how investment in the human genome project may contribute to understanding and preventing the adverse effects on human health of modifiable exposures.Genetic epidemiology—the theme of this issue of the International Journal of Epidemiology—is seen by many to be the only future for epidemiology, perhaps reflecting a growing awareness of the limitations of observational epidemiology1 (Box 1). Genetic epidemiology is concerned with understanding heritable aspects of disease risk, individual susceptibility to disease, and ultimately with contributing to a comprehensive molecular understanding of pathogenesis. The massive investment and expansion of human genetics, if it is to return value for the common good, must be integrated into public health functions. The human genome epidemiology network (HuGE Net—http://www.cdc.gov/genetics/huge.htm) has been established to promote the use of genetic knowledge—in terms of genetic tests and services—for disease prevention and health promotion.2,3 A broad taxonomy of human genome studies of public health relevance has been developed4 (Box 2). In this issue of the IJE, we publish a paper by Miguel Porta,5 who highlights the need for a more rational approach to genetic testing, given the likely low penetrance of many genes associated with cancers,6 likening the role of the genome to a jazz score that is interpreted and developed through experience and context—and is seldom predictable. Such insights may well temper enthusiasm for genetic testing in populations. However, in parallel to the approaches advocated by HuGE, genetic epidemiology can lead to a more robust understanding of environmental determinants of disease (e.g. dietary factors, occupational exposures, and health-related behaviours) relevant to whole populations (and not simply to genetically susceptible sub-populations).7–10 This approach has recently been referred to as ‘Mendelian randomization'.11–15 Here we begin by briefly reviewing reasons for current concerns about aetiological findings generated by conventional observational epidemiology and then we outline the potential contribution (and limitations) of Mendelian randomization.Box 1 ‘Epidemiology set to get fast-track treatment'‘A consortium of leading European research centres and pharmaceutical companies will this week announce a plan to transform epidemiology by combining it with the new techniques of high-throughput biology. They plan to create a new field of study—genomic epidemiology—by using screening technologies derived from the human genome project {\ldots} We think it is important to expand classical epidemiology and genetic epidemiology to take it to this high-throughput mode, says Esper Boel, vice-president of biotechnology research at Novo Nordisk. We want to use post-genomic technologies to create a new clinical science, to turn functional genomics into real clinical chemistry.'From: Butler D. Epidemiology set to get fast-track treatment.

abstract = {Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of height and body mass index (BMI) in ∼250000 European participants have led to the discovery of ∼700 and ∼100 nearly independent single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with these traits, respectively. Here we combine summary statistics from those two studies with GWAS of height and BMI performed in ∼450000 UK Biobank participants of European ancestry. Overall, our combined GWAS meta-analysis reaches N ∼700000 individuals and substantially increases the number of GWAS signals associated with these traits. We identified 3290 and 941 near-independent SNPs associated with height and BMI, respectively (at a revised genome-wide significance threshold of P {\textless} 1 × 10-8), including 1185 height-associated SNPs and 751 BMI-associated SNPs located within loci not previously identified by these two GWAS. The near-independent genome-wide significant SNPs explain ∼24.6{\%} of the variance of height and ∼6.0{\%} of the variance of BMI in an independent sample from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). Correlations between polygenic scores based upon these SNPs with actual height and BMI in HRS participants were ∼0.44 and ∼0.22, respectively. From analyses of integrating GWAS and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) data by summary-data-based Mendelian randomization, we identified an enrichment of eQTLs among lead height and BMI signals, prioritizing 610 and 138 genes, respectively. Our study demonstrates that, as previously predicted, increasing GWAS sample sizes continues to deliver, by the discovery of new loci, increasing prediction accuracy and providing additional data to achieve deeper insight into complex trait biology. All summary statistics are made available for follow-up studies.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The association between waist circumference and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) remains poorly explored. STUDY DESIGN: Longitudinal population-based cohort. SETTING {\&} PARTICIPANTS: Participants in the REGARDS (Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke) Study (n=30,239) with information for body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, spot urine albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR), and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR; n=26,960). PREDICTOR: Elevated waist circumference or BMI. OUTCOMES {\&} MEASUREMENTS: Incident cases of ESRD were identified through linkage of REGARDS participants with the US Renal Data System. RESULTS: Mean baseline age was 64.8 years, 45.8{\%} were men, and 40.3{\%} were black. Overall, 297 (1.1{\%}) individuals developed ESRD during a median of 6.3 years. After adjustment for all covariates including waist circumference, no significant association was noted between BMI categories and ESRD incidence compared to BMI of 18.5 to 24.9 kg/m2 (referent). Higher waist circumference categories showed significantly increased hazard rates of ESRD, with waist circumference ≥ 108 cm in women and ≥122 cm in men (highest category) showing a 3.97-fold higher hazard rate (95{\%} CI, 2.10-6.86) for ESRD compared to waist circumference {\textless} 80 cm in women and {\textless}94 cm in men (referent) after adjusting for demographic factors and BMI. However, no significant association was noted between any waist circumference category and ESRD incidence after adjustment for obesity-associated comorbid conditions and baseline ACR and eGFR. LIMITATIONS: Short follow-up period (6.3 years) to assess ESRD risk among adults with eGFRs{\textgreater}60 mL/min/1.73 m2. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of older adults, obesity as measured by waist circumference is associated with higher ESRD risk even with adjustment for BMI, whereas obesity as measured by BMI is not associated with higher ESRD risk after adjustment for waist circumference. However, no significant association is noted between increased waist circumference and ESRD risk after adjustment for obesity-related comorbid conditions, eGFR, and ACR.},

abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Obesity has become a worldwide epidemic that is driving increased morbidity and mortality from thrombotic disorders such as myocardial infarction, stroke, and venous thromboembolism. Effective prevention and treatment of thrombosis in obese patients is limited by an incomplete understanding of the underlying prothrombotic mechanisms and by uncertainties about risks, benefits, and dosing of anticoagulant drugs in this patient population. RECENT FINDINGS: This review summarizes our current understanding of established and emerging mechanisms contributing to the obesity-induced prothrombotic state. The mechanistic impact of chronic inflammation and impaired fibrinolysis in mediating obesity-associated thrombosis is highlighted. Recent data demonstrating the aberrant expression of adipokines and microRNAs, which appear to function as key modulators of proinflammatory and prothrombotic pathways in obesity, are also reviewed. Finally, some challenges and new approaches to the prevention and management of thrombotic disorders in obese and overweight patients are discussed. SUMMARY: Obesity-driven chronic inflammation and impaired fibrinolysis appear to be major effector mechanisms of thrombosis in obesity. The proinflammatory and hypofibrinolytic effects of obesity may be exacerbated by dysregulated expression and secretion of adipokines and microRNAs, which further increase the risk of thrombosis and suggest new potential targets for therapy.},

abstract = {Population studies suggest that atopic dermatitis (AD) is associated with an increased risk of obesity, however a causal relationship between these two conditions remains to be established. We therefore use Mendelian randomization (MR) to evaluate whether obesity and AD are causally interlinked. We used summary statistics extracted from genome wide association studies of Body Mass Index (BMI) and AD. MR analysis was performed in both directions to establish the direction of causality between BMI and AD. We find that genetically determined increase in adiposity is associated with increased risk of AD (odds ratio of AD 1.08 [95{\%} CI 1.01 to 1.14; p = 0.015] per unit increase in BMI). Conversely, genetically determined increased risk of AD is not associated with a higher BMI (change in BMI attributable to AD based on genetic information: 0.00; 95{\%} CI - 0.02 to 0.02; p = 0.862). There was no evidence for confounding of these genetic analyses by horizontal pleiotropy. Our results indicate that the association of AD with obesity is likely to reflect a causal role for adiposity in the development of AD. Our findings enhance understanding of the etiology of AD, and the basis for experimental studies to evaluate the mechanistic pathways by which adiposity promotes AD.},

Metabolomics is a growing and powerful technology capable of detecting hundreds to thousands of metabolites in tissues and biofluids. The recent advances in metabolomics technologies have enabled a deeper investigation into the metabolism of cancer and a better understanding of how cancer cells use glycolysis, known as the “Warburg effect,” advantageously to produce the amino acids, nucleotides and lipids necessary for tumor proliferation and vascularization. Currently, metabolomics research is being used to discover diagnostic cancer biomarkers in the clinic, to better understand its complex heterogeneous nature, to discover pathways involved in cancer that could be used for new targets and to monitor metabolic biomarkers during therapeutic intervention. These metabolomics approaches may also provide clues to personalized cancer treatments by providing useful information to the clinician about the cancer patient's response to medical interventions.},

abstract = {Observational studies suggest that higher birth weight (BW) is associated with increased risk of breast cancer in adult life. We conducted a two-sample Mendelian randomisation (MR) study to assess whether this association is causal. Sixty independent single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) known to be associated at P {\textless} 5 × 10(-8) with BW were used to construct (1) a 41-SNP instrumental variable (IV) for univariable MR after removing SNPs with pleiotropic associations with other breast cancer risk factors and (2) a 49-SNP IV for multivariable MR after filtering SNPs for data availability. BW predicted by the 41-SNP IV was not associated with overall breast cancer risk in inverse-variance weighted (IVW) univariable MR analysis of genetic association data from 122,977 breast cancer cases and 105,974 controls (odds ratio = 0.86 per 500 g higher BW; 95{\%} confidence interval 0.73-1.01). Sensitivity analyses using four alternative methods and three alternative IVs, including an IV with 59 of the 60 BW-associated SNPs, yielded similar results. Multivariable MR adjusting for the effects of the 49-SNP IV on birth length, adult height, adult body mass index, age at menarche, and age at menopause using IVW and MR-Egger methods provided estimates consistent with univariable analyses. Results were also similar when all analyses were repeated after restricting to estrogen receptor-positive or -negative breast cancer cases. Point estimates of the odds ratios from most analyses performed indicated an inverse relationship between genetically-predicted BW and breast cancer, but we are unable to rule out an association between the non-genetically-determined component of BW and breast cancer. Thus, genetically-predicted higher BW was not associated with an increased risk of breast cancer in adult life in our MR study.},

Although Asians had lower BMI, they were fatter than whites of both sexes. The correlations between fat{\%} and BMI varied by BMI and sex and race. Comparisons in anthropometry show that Asians had more subcutaneous fat than did whites and had different fat distributions from whites. Asians had more upper-body subcutaneous fat than did whites. The magnitude of differences between the two races was greater in females than in males. Prediction equations developed for each sex and race, based on BMI alone, gave SEEs ranging from 4.4{\%} to 5.7{\%}.

abstract = {A key assumption of Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis is that there is no association between the genetic variants used as instruments and the outcome other than through the exposure of interest. One way in which this assumption can be violated is through population stratification, which can introduce confounding of the relationship between the genetic variants and the outcome and so induce an association between them. Negative control outcomes are increasingly used to detect unobserved confounding in observational epidemiological studies. Here we consider the use of negative control outcomes in MR studies to detect confounding of the genetic variants and the exposure or outcome. As a negative control outcome in an MR study, we propose the use of phenotypes which are determined before the exposure and outcome but which are likely to be subject to the same confounding as the exposure or outcome of interest. We illustrate our method with a two-sample MR analysis of a preselected set of exposures on self-reported tanning ability and hair colour. Our results show that, of the 33 exposures considered, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of adiposity and education-related traits are likely to be subject to population stratification that is not controlled for through adjustment, and so any MR study including these traits may be subject to bias that cannot be identified through standard pleiotropy robust methods. Negative control outcomes should therefore be used regularly in MR studies to detect potential population stratification in the data used.},

We therefore developed MR-Base (http://www.mrbase.org): a platform that integrates a curated database of complete GWAS results (no restrictions according to statistical significance) with an application programming interface, web app and R packages that automate 2SMR. The software includes several sensitivity analyses for assessing the impact of horizontal pleiotropy and other violations of assumptions. The database currently comprises 11 billion single nucleotide polymorphism-trait associations from 1673 GWAS and is updated on a regular basis.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) parallels the rise in childhood obesity. MetS is associated with neurocognitive impairments in adults, but this is thought to be a long-term effect of poor metabolism. It would be important to ascertain whether these brain complications are also present among adolescents with MetS, a group without clinically manifest vascular disease and relatively short duration of poor metabolism. METHODS: Forty-nine adolescents with and 62 without MetS, matched on age, socioeconomic status, school grade, gender, and ethnicity, received endocrine, MRI, and neuropsychological evaluations. RESULTS: Adolescents with MetS showed significantly lower arithmetic, spelling, attention, and mental flexibility and a trend for lower overall intelligence. They also had, in a MetS-dose-related fashion, smaller hippocampal volumes, increased brain cerebrospinal fluid, and reductions of microstructural integrity in major white matter tracts. CONCLUSIONS: We document lower cognitive performance and reductions in brain structural integrity among adolescents with MetS, thus suggesting that even relatively short-term impairments in metabolism, in the absence of clinically manifest vascular disease, may give rise to brain complications. In view of these alarming results, it is plausible that obesity-associated metabolic disease, short of type 2 diabetes mellitus, may be mechanistically linked to lower the academic and professional potential of adolescents. Although obesity may not be enough to stir clinicians or even parents into action, these results in adolescents strongly argue for an early and comprehensive intervention. We propose that brain function be introduced among the parameters that need to be evaluated when considering early treatment of childhood obesity.},

abstract = {Summary The immunological processes involved in the collaborative defence of organisms are affected by nutritional status. Thus, a positive chronic imbalance between energy intake and expenditure leads to situations of obesity, which may influence unspecific and specific immune responses mediated by humoral and cell mediated mechanisms. Furthermore, several lines of evidence have supported a link between adipose tissue and immunocompetent cells. This interaction is illustrated in obesity, where excess adiposity and impaired immune function have been described in both humans and genetically obese rodents. However, limited and often controversial information exist comparing immunity in obese and non-obese subjects as well as about the cellular and molecular mechanisms implicated. In general terms, clinical and epidemiological data support the evidence that the incidence and severity of specific types of infectious illnesses are higher in obese persons as compared to lean individuals together with the occurrence of poor antibody responses to antigens in overweight subjects. Leptin might play a key role in linking nutritional status with T-cell function. The complexities and heterogeneity of the host defences concerning the immune response in different nutritional circumstances affecting the energy balance require an integral study of the immunocompetent cells, their subsets and products as well as specific and unspecific inducer/regulator systems. In this context, more research is needed to clarify the clinical implications of the alterations induced by obesity on the immune function.},

abstract = {Depression is more common in obese than non-obese individuals, especially in women, but the causal relationship between obesity and depression is complex and uncertain. Previous studies have used genetic variants associated with BMI to provide evidence that higher body mass index (BMI) causes depression, but have not tested whether this relationship is driven by the metabolic consequences of BMI nor for differences between men and women.We performed a Mendelian randomization study using 48 791 individuals with depression and 291 995 controls in the UK Biobank, to test for causal effects of higher BMI on depression (defined using self-report and Hospital Episode data). We used two genetic instruments, both representing higher BMI, but one with and one without its adverse metabolic consequences, in an attempt to ‘uncouple' the psychological component of obesity from the metabolic consequences. We further tested causal relationships in men and women separately, and using subsets of BMI variants from known physiological pathways.Higher BMI was strongly associated with higher odds of depression, especially in women. Mendelian randomization provided evidence that higher BMI partly causes depression. Using a 73-variant BMI genetic risk score, a genetically determined one standard deviation (1 SD) higher BMI (4.9 kg/m2) was associated with higher odds of depression in all individuals [odds ratio (OR): 1.18, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI): 1.09, 1.28, P = 0.00007) and women only (OR: 1.24, 95{\%} CI: 1.11, 1.39, P = 0.0001). Meta-analysis with 45 591 depression cases and 97 647 controls from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) strengthened the statistical confidence of the findings in all individuals. Similar effect size estimates were obtained using different Mendelian randomization methods, although not all reached P {\textless} 0.05. Using a metabolically favourable adiposity genetic risk score, and meta-analysing data from the UK biobank and PGC, a genetically determined 1 SD higher BMI (4.9 kg/m2) was associated with higher odds of depression in all individuals (OR: 1.26, 95{\%} CI: 1.06, 1.50], P = 0.010), but with weaker statistical confidence.Higher BMI, with and without its adverse metabolic consequences, is likely to have a causal role in determining the likelihood of an individual developing depression.},

abstract = {Mendelian randomization (MR) is a method for estimating the causal relationship between an exposure and an outcome using a genetic factor as an instrumental variable (IV) for the exposure. In the traditional MR setting, data on the IV, exposure, and outcome are available for all participants. However, obtaining complete exposure data may be difficult in some settings, due to high measurement costs or lack of appropriate biospecimens. We used simulated data sets to assess statistical power and bias for MR when exposure data are available for a subset (or an independent set) of participants. We show that obtaining exposure data for a subset of participants is a cost-efficient strategy, often having negligible effects on power in comparison with a traditional complete-data analysis. The size of the subset needed to achieve maximum power depends on IV strength, and maximum power is approximately equal to the power of traditional IV estimators. Weak IVs are shown to lead to bias towards the null when the subsample is small and towards the confounded association when the subset is relatively large. Various approaches for confidence interval calculation are considered. These results have important implications for reducing the costs and increasing the feasibility of MR studies.},

abstract = {Linear mixed models are a powerful statistical tool for identifying genetic associations and avoiding confounding. However, existing methods are computationally intractable in large cohorts and may not optimize power. All existing methods require time cost O(MN(2)) (where N is the number of samples and M is the number of SNPs) and implicitly assume an infinitesimal genetic architecture in which effect sizes are normally distributed, which can limit power. Here we present a far more efficient mixed-model association method, BOLT-LMM, which requires only a small number of O(MN) time iterations and increases power by modeling more realistic, non-infinitesimal genetic architectures via a Bayesian mixture prior on marker effect sizes. We applied BOLT-LMM to 9 quantitative traits in 23,294 samples from the Women's Genome Health Study (WGHS) and observed significant increases in power, consistent with simulations. Theory and simulations show that the boost in power increases with cohort size, making BOLT-LMM appealing for genome-wide association studies in large cohorts.},

All participants were free of clinical CVD at baseline with available BMI index and CVD outcomes data. Data were analyzed from October 2016 to July 2017.World Health Organization–standardized BMI categories.Total CVD and CVD subtype, including fatal and nonfatal coronary heart disease, stroke, congestive heart failure, and other CVD deaths. Heights and weights were measured directly by investigators in each study, and BMI was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared. We performed (1) modified Kaplan-Meier analysis to estimate lifetime risks, (2) adjusted competing Cox models to estimate joint cumulative risks for CVD or noncardiovascular death, and (3) the Irwin restricted mean to estimate years lived free of and with CVD.Of the 190 672 in-person examinations included in this study, the mean (SD) age was 46.0 (15.0) years for men and 58.7 (12.9) years for women, and 140 835 patients (73.9{\%}) were female. Compared with individuals with a normal BMI (defined as a BMI of 18.5 to 24.9), lifetime risks for incident CVD were higher in middle-aged adults in the overweight and obese groups. Compared with normal weight, among middle-aged men and women, competing hazard ratios for incident CVD were 1.21 (95{\%} CI, 1.14-1.28) and 1.32 (95{\%} CI, 1.24-1.40), respectively, for overweight (BMI, 25.0-29.9), 1.67 (95{\%} CI, 1.55-1.79) and 1.85 (95{\%} CI, 1.72-1.99) for obesity (BMI, 30.0-39.9), and 3.14 (95{\%} CI, 2.48-3.97) and 2.53 (95{\%} CI, 2.20-2.91) for morbid obesity (BMI, ≥40.0). Higher BMI had the strongest association with incident heart failure among CVD subtypes. Average years lived with CVD were longer for middle-aged adults in the overweight and obese groups compared with adults in the normal BMI group. Similar patterns were observed in younger and older adults.In this study, obesity was associated with shorter longevity and significantly increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality compared with normal BMI. Despite similar longevity compared with normal BMI, overweight was associated with significantly increased risk of developing CVD at an earlier age, resulting in a greater proportion of life lived with CVD morbidity.},

In general, we detect genetic substructure throughout the country, which reflects stronger regional genetic differences in Finland compared to, for example, the UK, which in a similar analysis was dominated by a single unstructured population. We expect that similar population genetic reference data sets will become available for many more populations in the near future with important applications, for example, in forensic genetics and in genetic association studies.

The obesity pandemic poses a unique set of problems for acute pancreatitis – both by increasing acute pancreatitis incidence, and worsening acute pancreatitis severity. This review explores these associations, underlying mechanisms, and potential therapies.

Recent findings

We review how the obesity associated increase in gallstones, surgical, and endoscopic interventions for obesity management, diabetes, and related medications such as incretin-based therapies and hypertriglyceridemia may increase the incidence of acute pancreatitis. The mechanism of how obesity may increase acute pancreatitis severity are discussed with a focus on cytokines, adipokines, damage-associated molecular patterns and unsaturated fatty acid-mediated lipotoxicity. The role of obesity in exacerbating pancreatic necrosis is discussed; focusing on obesity-associated pancreatic steatosis. We also discuss how peripancreatic fat necrosis worsens organ failure independent of pancreatic necrosis. Last, we discuss emerging therapies including choice of intravenous fluids and the use of lipase inhibitors which have shown promise during severe acute pancreatitis.

Summary

We discuss how obesity may contribute to increasing acute pancreatitis incidence, the role of lipolytic unsaturated fatty acid release in worsening acute pancreatitis, and potential approaches, including appropriate fluid management and lipase inhibition in improving acute pancreatitis outcomes.},

abstract = {Background Evidence from high-income countries shows that higher adiposity results in an adverse lipid profile, but it is unclear whether this association is similar in Sub-Saharan African (SSA) populations. This study aimed to assess the association between total and central adiposity measures and lipid profile in Malawi, exploring differences by sex and area of residence (rural/urban).Methods In this cross-sectional study, data from 12 096 rural and 12 847 urban Malawian residents were used. The associations of body mass index (BMI) and waist to hip ratio (WHR) with fasting lipids (total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) and triglycerides (TG)) were assessed by area and sex.Results After adjusting for potential confounders, higher BMI and WHR were linearly associated with increased TC, LDL-C and TG and reduced HDL-C. BMI was more strongly related to fasting lipids than was WHR. The associations of adiposity with adverse lipid profile were stronger in rural compared with urban residents. For instance, one SD increase in BMI was associated with 0.23 mmol/L (95{\%} CI 0.19 to 0.26) increase in TC in rural women and 0.13 mmol/L (95{\%} CI 0.11 to 0.15) in urban women. Sex differences in the associations between adiposity and lipids were less evident.Conclusions The consistent associations observed of higher adiposity with adverse lipid profiles in men and women living in rural and urban areas of Malawi highlight the emerging adverse cardio-metabolic epidemic in this poor population. Our findings underline the potential utility of BMI in estimating cardiovascular risk and highlight the need for greater investment to understand the long-term health outcomes of obesity and adverse lipid profiles and the extent to which lifestyle changes and treatments effectively prevent and modify adverse cardio-metabolic outcomes.},

Mediation analysis experiences a number of methodological difficulties, including bias due to confounding and measurement error. Mendelian randomisation (MR) can be used to improve causal inference for mediation analysis. We describe two approaches that can be used for estimating mediation analysis with MR: multivariable Mendelian randomisation (MVMR) and two-step Mendelian randomisation. We outline the approaches and provide code to demonstrate how they can be used in mediation analysis. We review issues that can affect analyses, including confounding, measurement error, weak instrument bias, and analysis of multiple mediators. Description of the methods is supplemented by simulated and real data examples. Although Mendelian randomisation relies on large sample sizes and strong assumptions, such as having strong instruments and no horizontally pleiotropic pathways, our examples demonstrate that it is unlikely to be affected by confounders of the exposure or mediator and the outcome, reverse causality and non-differential measurement error of the exposure or mediator. Both MVMR and two-step MR can be implemented in both individual-level MR and summary data MR, and can improve causal inference in mediation analysis.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

abstract = {We have investigated a potential mechanism by which a diet, similar in composition to the typical diet of most industrialized western societies rich in saturated fat and refined sugar (HFS), can influence brain structure and function via regulation of neurotrophins. We show that animals that learn a spatial memory task faster have more brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA and protein in the hippocampus. Two months on the HFS diet were sufficient to reduce hippocampal level of BDNF and spatial learning performance. Consequent to the action of BDNF on synaptic function, downstream effectors for the action of BDNF on synaptic plasticity were reduced proportionally to BDNF levels, in the hippocampus of rats maintained on the HFS diet between 2 and 24 months. In particular, animals maintained on the HFS diet showed a decrease in levels of: (i) synapsin I mRNA and protein (total and phosphorylated), important for neurotransmitter release; (ii) cyclic AMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) mRNA and protein (total and phosphorylated); CREB is required for various forms of memory and is under regulatory control of BDNF; (iii) growth-associated protein 43 mRNA, important for neurite outgrowth, neurotransmitter release, and learning and memory. Diet-related changes were specific for the hippocampus consequent to its role in memory formation, and did not involve neurotrophin-3, another member of the neurotrophin family. Our results indicate that a popularly consumed diet can influence crucial aspects of neuronal and behavioral plasticity associated with the function of BDNF.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Metabolomics may unravel important biological pathways involved in the pathophysiology of childhood obesity. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to 1) identify metabolites that differ significantly between nonobese and obese Hispanic children; 2) collapse metabolites into principal components (PCs) associated with obesity and metabolic risk, specifically hyperinsulinemia, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperleptinemia, and hyperuricemia; and 3) identify metabolites associated with energy expenditure and fat oxidation. DESIGN: This trial was a cross-sectional observational study of metabolomics by using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analyses performed on fasting plasma samples from 353 nonobese and 450 obese Hispanic children. RESULTS: Branched-chained amino acids (BCAAs) (Leu, Ile, and Val) and their catabolites, propionylcarnitine and butyrylcarnitine, were significantly elevated in obese children. Strikingly lower lysolipids and dicarboxylated fatty acids were seen in obese children. Steroid derivatives were markedly higher in obese children as were markers of inflammation and oxidative stress. PC6 (BCAAs and aromatic AAs) and PC10 (asparagine, glycine, and serine) made the largest contributions to body mass index, and PC10 and PC12 (acylcarnitines) made the largest contributions to adiposity. Metabolic risk factors and total energy expenditure were associated with PC6, PC9 (AA and tricarboxylic acid cycle metabolites), and PC10. Fat oxidation was inversely related to PC8 (lysolipids) and positively related to PC16 (acylcarnitines). CONCLUSIONS: Global metabolomic profiling in nonobese and obese children replicates the increased BCAA and acylcarnitine catabolism and changes in nucleotides, lysolipids, and inflammation markers seen in obese adults; however, a strong signature of reduced fatty acid catabolism and increased steroid derivatives may be unique to obese children. Metabolic flexibility in fuel use observed in obese children may occur through the activation of alternative intermediary pathways. Insulin resistance, hyperleptinemia, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperuricemia, and oxidative stress and inflammation evident in obese children are associated with distinct metabolomic profiles.},

Fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4), also known as adipocyte FABP (A-FABP) or aP2, is mainly expressed in adipocytes and macrophages and plays an important role in the development of insulin resistance and atherosclerosis in relation to metaflammation. Despite lack of a typical secretory signal peptide, FABP4 has been shown to be released from adipocytes in a non-classical pathway associated with lipolysis, possibly acting as an adipokine. Elevation of circulating FABP4 levels is associated with obesity, insulin resistance, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cardiac dysfunction, atherosclerosis, and cardiovascular events. Furthermore, ectopic expression and function of FABP4 in several types of cells and tissues have been recently demonstrated. Here, we discuss both the significant role of FABP4 in pathophysiological insights and its usefulness as a biomarker of metabolic and cardiovascular diseases.},

The recent dramatic expansion of study sizes improves power of estimation of effect sizes, genomic prediction, causal inference, and polygenic selection, but it simultaneously increases susceptibility of these methods to bias due to subtle population structure. Standard methods using genetic principal components to correct for structure might not always be appropriate and we use a simulation study to illustrate when correction might be ineffective for avoiding biases. New methods such as trans-ethnic modeling and chromosome painting allow for a richer understanding of the relationship between traits and population structure. We illustrate the arguments using real examples (stroke and educational attainment) and provide a more nuanced understanding of population structure, which is set to be revisited as a critical aspect of future analyses in genetic epidemiology. We also make simple recommendations for how problems can be avoided in the future. Our results have particular importance for the implementation of GWAS meta-analysis, for prediction of traits, and for causal inference.},

abstract = {Mendelian randomization (MR) is the use of genetic variants associated with an exposure to estimate the causal effect of that exposure on an outcome. Mediation analysis is the method of decomposing the effects of an exposure on an outcome, which act directly, and those that act via mediating variables. These effects are decomposed through the use of multivariable analysis to estimate the causal effects between three types of variables: exposures, mediators, and an outcome. Multivariable MR (MVMR) is a recent extension to MR that uses genetic variants associated with multiple, potentially related exposures to estimate the effect of each exposure on a single outcome. MVMR allows for equivalent analysis to mediation within the MR framework and therefore can also be used to estimate mediation effects. This approach retains the benefits of using genetic instruments for causal inference, such as avoiding bias due to confounding, while allowing for estimation of the different effects required for mediation analysis. This review explains MVMR, what is estimated when one exposure is a mediator of another in an MVMR estimation, and how MR and MVMR can therefore be used to estimate mediated effects. This review then goes on to consider the advantages and limitations of using MR and MVMR to conduct mediation analysis.},

abstract = {Abstract. Current orthodoxy states that coronary heart disease results from the unhealthy lifestyles of westernized adults together with a contribution from genetic inheritance. This does not provide a secure basis for prevention of the disease. Geographical studies gave the first clue that the disease originates during intra-uterine development. Variations in mortality from the disease across England and Wales were shown to correlate closely with past differences in death rates among newborn babies. In the past most deaths among newborns were attributed to low birthweight. This led to the hypothesis that undernutrition in utero permanently changes the body's structure, function and metabolism in ways that lead to coronary heart disease in later life. The association between low birthweight and coronary heart disease has been confirmed in longitudinal studies of men and women around the world. The developmental model of the origins of the disease offers a new way forward.},

abstract = {Objectives This study examined associations between anthropometric measures (body mass index, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, waist-to-height ratio [WHtR]) and risk of incident cardiovascular disease (CVD) (including nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal ischemic stroke, and cardiovascular death). Background Controversy exists regarding the optimal approach to measure adiposity, and the utility of body mass index has been questioned. Methods Participants included 16,332 men in the Physicians' Health Study (mean age 61 years in 1991) and 32,700 women in the Women's Health Study (mean age 61 years in 1999). We used Cox proportional hazards models to determine relative risks and 95{\%} confidence intervals (CIs) for developing CVD according to self-reported anthropometric indexes. Results A total of 1,505 CVD cases occurred in men and 414 occurred in women (median follow-up 14.2 and 5.5 years, respectively). Although WHtR demonstrated statistically the strongest associations with CVD and best model fit, CVD risk increased linearly and significantly with higher levels of all indexes. Adjusting for confounders, the relative risk for CVD was 0.58 (95{\%} CI: 0.32 to 1.05) for men with the lowest WHtR ({\textless}0.45) and 2.36 (95{\%} CI: 1.61 to 3.47) for the highest WHtR (≥0.69; vs. WHtR 0.49 to {\textless}0.53). Among women, the relative risk was 0.65 (95{\%} CI: 0.33 to 1.31) for those with the lowest WHtR ({\textless}0.42) and 2.33 (95{\%} CI: 1.66 to 3.28) for the highest WHtR (≥0.68; vs. WHtR 0.47 to {\textless}0.52). Conclusions The WHtR demonstrated statistically the best model fit and strongest associations with CVD. However, compared with body mass index, differences in cardiovascular risk assessment using other indexes were small and likely not clinically consequential. Our findings emphasize that higher levels of adiposity, however measured, confer increased risk of CVD.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mendelian randomization uses genetic variants, assumed to be instrumental variables for a particular exposure, to estimate the causal effect of that exposure on an outcome. If the instrumental variable criteria are satisfied, the resulting estimator is consistent even in the presence of unmeasured confounding and reverse causation. METHODS: We extend the Mendelian randomization paradigm to investigate more complex networks of relationships between variables, in particular where some of the effect of an exposure on the outcome may operate through an intermediate variable (a mediator). If instrumental variables for the exposure and mediator are available, direct and indirect effects of the exposure on the outcome can be estimated, for example using either a regression-based method or structural equation models. The direction of effect between the exposure and a possible mediator can also be assessed. Methods are illustrated in an applied example considering causal relationships between body mass index, C-reactive protein and uric acid. RESULTS: These estimators are consistent in the presence of unmeasured confounding if, in addition to the instrumental variable assumptions, the effects of both the exposure on the mediator and the mediator on the outcome are homogeneous across individuals and linear without interactions. Nevertheless, a simulation study demonstrates that even considerable heterogeneity in these effects does not lead to bias in the estimates. CONCLUSIONS: These methods can be used to estimate direct and indirect causal effects in a mediation setting, and have potential for the investigation of more complex networks between multiple interrelated exposures and disease outcomes.},

abstract = {Obesity has become a major worldwide health problem. In every single country in the world, the incidence of obesity is rising continuously and therefore, the associated morbidity, mortality and both medical and economical costs are expected to increase as well. The majority of these complications are related to co-morbid conditions that include coronary artery disease, hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, respiratory disorders and dyslipidemia. Obesity increases cardiovascular risk through risk factors such as increased fasting plasma triglycerides, high LDL cholesterol, low HDL cholesterol, elevated blood glucose and insulin levels and high blood pressure. Novel lipid dependent, metabolic risk factors associated to obesity are the presence of the small dense LDL phenotype, postprandial hyperlipidemia with accumulation of atherogenic remnants and hepatic overproduction of apoB containing lipoproteins. All these lipid abnormalities are typical features of the metabolic syndrome and may be associated to a pro-inflammatory gradient which in part may originate in the adipose tissue itself and directly affect the endothelium. An important link between obesity, the metabolic syndrome and dyslipidemia, seems to be the development of insulin resistance in peripheral tissues leading to an enhanced hepatic flux of fatty acids from dietary sources, intravascular lipolysis and from adipose tissue resistant to the antilipolytic effects of insulin. The current review will focus on these aspects of lipid metabolism in obesity and potential interventions to treat the obesity related dyslipidemia.},

abstract = {The concept of genetic canalization has had an abiding influence on views of complex-trait evolution. A genetically canalized system has evolved to become less sensitive to the effects of mutation. When a gene product that supports canalization is compromised, the phenotypic impacts of a mutation should be more pronounced. This expected increase in mutational effects not only has important consequences for evolution, but has also motivated strategies to treat disease. However, recent studies demonstrate that, when putative agents of genetic canalization are impaired, systems do not behave as expected. Here, we review the evidence that is used to infer whether particular gene products are agents of genetic canalization. Then we explain how such inferences often succumb to a converse error. We go on to show that several candidate agents of genetic canalization increase the phenotypic impacts of some mutations while decreasing the phenotypic impacts of others. These observations suggest that whether a gene product acts as a 'buffer' (lessening mutational effects) or a 'potentiator' (increasing mutational effects) is not a fixed property of the gene product but instead differs for the different mutations with which it interacts. To investigate features of genetic interactions that might predispose them toward buffering versus potentiation, we explore simulated gene-regulatory networks. Similarly to putative agents of genetic canalization, the gene products in simulated networks also modify the phenotypic effects of mutations in other genes without a strong overall tendency towards lessening or increasing these effects. In sum, these observations call into question whether complex traits have evolved to become less sensitive (i.e., are canalized) to genetic change, and the degree to which trends exist that predict how one genetic change might alter another's impact. We conclude by discussing approaches to address these and other open questions that are brought into focus by re-thinking genetic canalization.},

abstract = {Metabolomic profiling of obese versus lean humans reveals a branched-chain amino acid (BCAA)-related metabolite signature that is suggestive of increased catabolism of BCAA and correlated with insulin resistance. To test its impact on metabolic homeostasis, we fed rats on high-fat (HF), HF with supplemented BCAA (HF/BCAA), or standard chow (SC) diets. Despite having reduced food intake and a low rate of weight gain equivalent to the SC group, HF/BCAA rats were as insulin resistant as HF rats. Pair-feeding of HF diet to match the HF/BCAA animals or BCAA addition to SC diet did not cause insulin resistance. Insulin resistance induced by HF/BCAA feeding was accompanied by chronic phosphorylation of mTOR, JNK, and IRS1Ser307 and by accumulation of multiple acylcarnitines in muscle, and it was reversed by the mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin. Our findings show that in the context of a dietary pattern that includes high fat consumption, BCAA contributes to development of obesity-associated insulin resistance.},

abstract = {There are two popular statistical models for meta-analysis, the fixed-effect model  and the random-effects model. The fact that these two models employ similar sets of formulas to compute statistics, and sometimes yield similar estimates for the various parameters, may lead people to believe that the models are interchangeable. In fact, though, the models represent fundamentally different assumptions about the data. The selection of the appropriate model is important to ensure that the various statistics are estimated correctly. Additionally, and more fundamentally, the model serves to place the analysis in context. It provides a framework for the goals of the analysis as well as for the interpretation of the statistics. In this paper we explain the key assumptions of each model, and then outline the differences between the models. We conclude with a discussion of factors to consider when choosing between the two models. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2010 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: High body-mass index (BMI) predisposes to several site-specific cancers, but a large-scale systematic and detailed characterisation of patterns of risk across all common cancers adjusted for potential confounders has not previously been undertaken. We aimed to investigate the links between BMI and the most common site-specific cancers. METHODS: With primary care data from individuals in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink with BMI data, we fitted Cox models to investigate associations between BMI and 22 of the most common cancers, adjusting for potential confounders. We fitted linear then non-linear (spline) models; investigated effect modification by sex, menopausal status, smoking, and age; and calculated population effects. FINDINGS: 5{\textperiodcentered}24 million individuals were included; 166,955 developed cancers of interest. BMI was associated with 17 of 22 cancers, but effects varied substantially by site. Each 5 kg/m(2) increase in BMI was roughly linearly associated with cancers of the uterus (hazard ratio [HR] 1{\textperiodcentered}62, 99{\%} CI 1{\textperiodcentered}56-1{\textperiodcentered}69; p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001), gallbladder (1{\textperiodcentered}31, 1{\textperiodcentered}12-1{\textperiodcentered}52; p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001), kidney (1{\textperiodcentered}25, 1{\textperiodcentered}17-1{\textperiodcentered}33; p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001), cervix (1{\textperiodcentered}10, 1{\textperiodcentered}03-1{\textperiodcentered}17; p=0{\textperiodcentered}00035), thyroid (1{\textperiodcentered}09, 1{\textperiodcentered}00-1{\textperiodcentered}19; p=0{\textperiodcentered}0088), and leukaemia (1{\textperiodcentered}09, 1{\textperiodcentered}05-1{\textperiodcentered}13; p≤0{\textperiodcentered}0001). BMI was positively associated with liver (1{\textperiodcentered}19, 1{\textperiodcentered}12-1{\textperiodcentered}27), colon (1{\textperiodcentered}10, 1{\textperiodcentered}07-1{\textperiodcentered}13), ovarian (1{\textperiodcentered}09, 1.04-1.14), and postmenopausal breast cancers (1{\textperiodcentered}05, 1{\textperiodcentered}03-1{\textperiodcentered}07) overall (all p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001), but these effects varied by underlying BMI or individual-level characteristics. We estimated inverse associations with prostate and premenopausal breast cancer risk, both overall (prostate 0{\textperiodcentered}98, 0{\textperiodcentered}95-1{\textperiodcentered}00; premenopausal breast cancer 0{\textperiodcentered}89, 0{\textperiodcentered}86-0{\textperiodcentered}92) and in never-smokers (prostate 0{\textperiodcentered}96, 0{\textperiodcentered}93-0{\textperiodcentered}99; premenopausal breast cancer 0{\textperiodcentered}89, 0{\textperiodcentered}85-0{\textperiodcentered}94). By contrast, for lung and oral cavity cancer, we observed no association in never smokers (lung 0{\textperiodcentered}99, 0{\textperiodcentered}93-1{\textperiodcentered}05; oral cavity 1{\textperiodcentered}07, 0{\textperiodcentered}91-1{\textperiodcentered}26): inverse associations overall were driven by current smokers and ex-smokers, probably because of residual confounding by smoking amount. Assuming causality, 41{\%} of uterine and 10{\%} or more of gallbladder, kidney, liver, and colon cancers could be attributable to excess weight. We estimated that a 1 kg/m(2) population-wide increase in BMI would result in 3790 additional annual UK patients developing one of the ten cancers positively associated with BMI. INTERPRETATION: BMI is associated with cancer risk, with substantial population-level effects. The heterogeneity in the effects suggests that different mechanisms are associated with different cancer sites and different patient subgroups.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Circulating amino acids, such as branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) and  aromatic amino acids (AAAs), have been associated with diabetes risk; however, little is known about how a long-term dietary intervention for weight loss affects circulating amino acids. OBJECTIVES: We examined the effects of weight-loss diets on long-term changes in plasma amino acids and the associations of these changes with weight loss and the improvement of insulin resistance. DESIGN: We repeatedly measured plasma amino acid profiles over 2 y in overweight or obese participants from 2 randomized, dietary intervention, weight-loss trials [774 subjects from the POUNDS LOST (Preventing Overweight Using Novel Dietary Strategies Trial) and 318 subjects from the DIRECT (Dietary Intervention Randomized Controlled Trial)]. RESULTS: Intervention diets consistently lowered most of the amino acid concentrations, including BCAAs and AAAs, in both trials. In the POUNDS LOST, average-protein diets (15{\%} of daily energy) showed stronger effects than did high-protein diets (25{\%} of daily energy) on reducing concentrations of the diabetes-associated BCAA valine at 6 mo independent of the weight change. In both trials, weight loss was directly related to the concurrent reduction of the BCAAs leucine and isoleucine, the AAAs tyrosine and phenylalanine, and 4 other amino acids. For example, per kilogram of weight loss, there was a 0.04-SD decrease in log tyrosine (∼0.6 $\mu$mol/L) in both trials. In addition, we showed that reductions in alanine and the AAA tyrosine were significantly related to improved insulin resistance (measured with the use of the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance), independent of weight loss, in both trials (both P {\textless} 0.05). For example, per 1-SD decrease in log tyrosine (∼17 $\mu$mol/L), there was a 0.04-SD (∼3{\%}) improvement in insulin resistance in the POUNDS LOST and a 0.13-SD (∼8{\%}) improvement in insulin resistance in the DIRECT. CONCLUSION: Our findings underscore the potential importance of dietary interventions in improving amino acid profiles (i.e., reducing diabetes risk-enhancing amino acid concentrations) along with and beyond weight loss. The POUNDS LOST and the DIRECT were registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00072995 and NCT00160108, respectively.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Being overweight or obese is associated with increased breast cancer  risk and disease severity among postmenopausal women, but whether extent of mammography use and accuracy modify this association and further contribute to increases in disease severity at diagnosis among overweight and obese women is unclear. METHODS: We prospectively collected data during 1996-2005 on 287,115 postmenopausal women not using hormone therapy (HT) who underwent 614,562 mammography examinations; 4,446 women were diagnosed with breast cancer within 12 months of a mammography examination. We calculated rates per 1,000 mammography examinations of large ({\textgreater}15 mm), advanced-stage (IIb, III, or IV), high-grade (3 or 4), estrogen receptor (ER)-positive and -negative, and screen-detected and non-screen-detected breast cancer across body mass index (BMI, kg/m(2)) groups defined as normal (18.5-24.9), overweight (25.0-29.9), obese class I (30.0-34.9), and obese class II/III ({\textgreater} or =35.0), adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, and mammography registry and use. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Adjusted rates per 1000 mammography examinations of overall breast cancer increased across BMI groups (6.6 normal, 7.4 overweight, 7.9 obese I, 8.5 obese II/III; P(trend) {\textless} .001), as did rates of advanced disease, including large invasive (2.3 normal, 2.6 overweight, 2.9 obese I, 3.2 obese II/III; P(trend) {\textless} .001), advanced-stage (0.8 normal, 0.9 overweight, 1.3 obese I, 1.5 obese II/III; P(trend) {\textless} .001), and high nuclear grade (1.5 normal, 1.7 overweight, 1.7 obese I, 1.9 obese II/III; P(trend) = .10) tumors. Rates of ER-positive tumors increased across BMI groups (P(trend) {\textless} .001); rates of ER-negative tumors did not. Rates of screen-detected cancers were higher among overweight and obese women than normal and underweight women, but rates of non-screen-detected (false-negative) cancers were similar. Rates of advanced breast cancer increased across BMI groups regardless of extent of mammography use. CONCLUSIONS: Patterns of mammography use and mammography accuracy are not the primary reasons for higher rates of advanced breast cancer among overweight and obese postmenopausal women not using HT; thus, biologic differences in breast tumor development and/or progression may be important.},

However, in addition to perturbation due to disease, the metabolomic profile of urine and plasma has also been shown to vary due to many intrinsic physiological factors such as age, sex, hormonal status and diurnal variation. Characterisation of this normal degree of variation in the metabolomic profiles of human biofluids is a necessary and important step in the development of metabolomics for use in nutrition-related research. The current review focuses on the impact of sex on the metabolomic profile. A number of studies have reported that sex impacts metabolites such as amino acids, lipids, sugars and keto acids. Furthermore, we examine the effect of the menstrual cycle on the metabolomic profile. Responses to dietary interventions can also differ between the sexes and highlighting this is important for the development of the field of precision nutrition.},

abstract = {Abstract Quantitative traits analyzed in Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) are often nonnormally distributed. For such traits, association tests based on standard linear regression are subject to reduced power and inflated type I error in finite samples. Applying the rank-based inverse normal transformation (INT) to nonnormally distributed traits has become common practice in GWAS. However, the different variations on INT-based association testing have not been formally defined, and guidance is lacking on when to use which approach. In this paper, we formally define and systematically compare the direct (D-INT) and indirect (I-INT) INT-based association tests. We discuss their assumptions, underlying generative models, and connections. We demonstrate that the relative powers of D-INT and I-INT depend on the underlying data generating process. Since neither approach is uniformly most powerful, we combine them into an adaptive omnibus test (O-INT). O-INT is robust to model misspecification, protects the type I error, and is well powered against a wide range of nonnormally distributed traits. Extensive simulations were conducted to examine the finite sample operating characteristics of these tests. Our results demonstrate that, for nonnormally distributed traits, INT-based tests outperform the standard untransformed association test, both in terms of power and type I error rate control. We apply the proposed methods to GWAS of spirometry traits in the UK Biobank. O-INT has been implemented in the R package RNOmni, which is available on CRAN.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To review progress in understanding the methods and results concerning the causal contribution of body mass index (BMI) to health and disease. METHODS: In the context of conventional evidence focused on the relationship between BMI and health, this review considers current literature on the common, population-based, genetic contribution to BMI and how this has fed into the developing field of applied epidemiology. RESULTS: Technological and analytical developments have driven considerable success in identifying genetic variants relevant to BMI. This has enabled the implementation of Mendelian randomization to address questions of causality. The product of this work has been the implication of BMI as a causal agent in a host of health outcomes. Further breakdown of causal pathways by integration with other "omics" technologies promises to deliver additional benefit. CONCLUSIONS: Gaps remain in our understanding of BMI as a risk factor for health and disease, and while promising, applied genetic epidemiology should be considered alongside alternative methods for assessing the impact of BMI on health. Potential limitations, relating to inappropriate or nonspecific measures of obesity and the improper use of genetic instruments, will need to be explored and incorporated into future research aiming to dissect BMI as a risk factor.},

abstract = {Abstract Despite the increasing prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), its pathogenesis and clinical significance remain poorly defined. In this study, we examined and compared the distribution of hepatic triglyceride content (HTGC) in 2,287 subjects from a multiethnic, population-based sample (32.1{\%} white, 48.3{\%} black, and 17.5{\%} Hispanic) using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. HTGC varied over a wide range (0.0{\%}-41.7{\%}; median, 3.6{\%}) in the population. Almost one third of the population had hepatic steatosis, and most subjects with hepatic steatosis had normal levels of serum alanine aminotransferase (79{\%}). The frequency of hepatic steatosis varied significantly with ethnicity (45{\%} in Hispanics; 33{\%} in whites; 24{\%} in blacks) and sex (42{\%} in white men; 24{\%} in white women). The higher prevalence of hepatic steatosis in Hispanics was due to the higher prevalence of obesity and insulin resistance in this ethnic group. However, the lower frequency of hepatic steatosis in blacks was not explained by ethnic differences in body mass index, insulin resistance, ethanol ingestion, or medication use. The prevalence of hepatic steatosis was greater in men than women among whites, but not in blacks or Hispanics. The ethnic differences in the frequency of hepatic steatosis in this study mirror those observed previously for NAFLD-related cirrhosis (Hispanics {\textgreater} whites {\textgreater} blacks). In conclusion, the significant ethnic and sex differences in the prevalence of hepatic steatosis documented in this study may have a profound impact on susceptibility to steatosis-related liver disease.

abstract = {Obesity is a major cause of type 2 diabetes, clinically evidenced as hyperglycemia. The altered glucose homeostasis is caused by faulty signal transduction via the insulin signaling proteins, which results in decreased glucose uptake by the muscle, altered lipogenesis, and increased glucose output by the liver. The etiology of this derangement in insulin signaling is related to a chronic inflammatory state, leading to the induction of inducible nitric oxide synthase and release of high levels of nitric oxide and reactive nitrogen species, which together cause posttranslational modifications in the signaling proteins. There are substantial differences in the molecular mechanisms of insulin resistance in muscle versus liver. Hormones and cytokines from adipocytes can enhance or inhibit both glycemic sensing and insulin signaling. The role of the central nervous system in glucose homeostasis also has been established. Multipronged therapies aimed at rectifying obesity-induced anomalies in both central nervous system and peripheral tissues may prove to be beneficial.},

abstract = {Background: Mendelian randomization (MR) is being increasingly used to strengthen causal inference in observational studies. Availability of summary data of genetic associations for a variety of phenotypes from large genome-wide association studies (GWAS) allows straightforward application of MR using summary data methods, typically in a two-sample design. In addition to the conventional inverse variance weighting (IVW) method, recently developed summary data MR methods, such as the MR-Egger and weighted median approaches, allow a relaxation of the instrumental variable assumptions. Methods: Here, a new method - the mode-based estimate (MBE) - is proposed to obtain a single causal effect estimate from multiple genetic instruments. The MBE is consistent when the largest number of similar (identical in infinite samples) individual-instrument causal effect estimates comes from valid instruments, even if the majority of instruments are invalid. We evaluate the performance of the method in simulations designed to mimic the two-sample summary data setting, and demonstrate its use by investigating the causal effect of plasma lipid fractions and urate levels on coronary heart disease risk. Results: The MBE presented less bias and lower type-I error rates than other methods under the null in many situations. Its power to detect a causal effect was smaller compared with the IVW and weighted median methods, but was larger than that of MR-Egger regression, with sample size requirements typically smaller than those available from GWAS consortia. Conclusions: The MBE relaxes the instrumental variable assumptions, and should be used in combination with other approaches in sensitivity analyses.},

abstract = {Background: Overweight and obesity amongst women of reproductive age are increasingly common in developed economies and are shown to adversely affect birth outcomes and both childhood and adulthood health risks in the offspring. Metabolic profiling in conditions of overweight and obesity in pregnancy could potentially be applied to elucidate the molecular basis of the adverse effects of gestational weight gain (GWG) and postpartum weight loss (WL) on future risks for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and other chronic diseases. Methods: Biofluid samples were collected from 114 ethnically diverse pregnant women with body mass index (BMI) between 25 and 40 kg/m2 from Chicago (US), as part of a randomized lifestyle intervention trial (Maternal Offspring Metabolics: Family Intervention Trial; NCT01631747). At 15 weeks, 35 weeks of gestation, and at 1 year postpartum, the blood plasma lipidome and metabolic profile of urine samples were analyzed by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H NMR) respectively. Results: Urinary 4-deoxyerythronic acid and 4-deoxythreonic acid were found to be positively correlated to BMI. Seventeen plasma lipids were found to be associated with GWG and 16 lipids were found to be associated with WL, which included phosphatidylinositols (PI), phosphatidylcholines (PC), lysophospholipids (lyso-), sphingomyelins (SM) and ether phosphatidylcholine (PC-O). Three phospholipids found to be positively associated with GWG all contained palmitate side-chains, and amongst the 14 lipids that were negatively associated with GWG, seven were PC-O. Six of eight lipids found to be negatively associated with WL contained an 18:2 fatty acid side-chain. Conclusions: Maternal obesity was associated with characteristic urine and plasma metabolic phenotypes, and phospholipid profile was found to be associated with both GWG and postpartum WL in metabolically healthy pregnant women with overweight/obesity. Postpartum WL may be linked to the reduction in the intake of linoleic acid/conjugated linoleic acid food sources in our study population.},

abstract = {Mendelian randomization (MR) uses genetic data to probe questions of causality in epidemiological research, by invoking the Instrumental Variable (IV) assumptions. In recent years, it has become commonplace to attempt MR analyses by synthesising summary data estimates of genetic association gleaned from large and independent study populations. This is referred to as two-sample summary data MR. Unfortunately, due to the sheer number of variants that can be easily included into summary data MR analyses, it is increasingly likely that some do not meet the IV assumptions due to pleiotropy. There is a pressing need to develop methods that can both detect and correct for pleiotropy, in order to preserve the validity of the MR approach in this context. In this paper, we aim to clarify how established methods of meta-regression and random effects modelling from mainstream meta-analysis are being adapted to perform this task. Specifically, we focus on two contrastin g approaches: the Inverse Variance Weighted (IVW) method which assumes in its simplest form that all genetic variants are valid IVs, and the method of MR-Egger regression that allows all variants to violate the IV assumptions, albeit in a specific way. We investigate the ability of two popular random effects models to provide robustness to pleiotropy under the IVW approach, and propose statistics to quantify the relative goodness-of-fit of the IVW approach over MR-Egger regression. {\textcopyright} 2017 The Authors.

abstract = {AIM: Research in animals has shown that altering foetal nutrition by under-nourishing or over-nourishing the mother or rendering her diabetic or foetal exposure to glucocorticoids and toxins can programme obesity in later life. The increased adiposity is mediated by permanent changes in appetite, food choices, physical activity and energy metabolism. In humans, increased adiposity has been shown in people who experienced foetal under-nutrition due to maternal famine or over-nutrition due to maternal diabetes. Lower birth weight (a proxy for foetal under-nutrition) is associated with a reduced adult lean mass and increased intra-abdominal fat. Higher birth-weight caused by maternal diabetes is associated with increased total fat mass and obesity in later life. There is growing evidence that maternal obesity, without diabetes, is also a risk factor for obesity in the child, due to foetal over-nutrition effects. Maternal smoking is associated with an increased risk of obesity in the children, although a causal link has not been proven. Other foetal exposures associated with increased adiposity in animals include glucocorticoids and endocrine disruptors. CONCLUSIONS: Reversing the current obesity epidemic will require greater attention to, and better understanding of, these inter-generational (mother-offspring) factors that programme body composition during early development.},

abstract = {Abstract Objective: To investigate whether the association between BMI and all-cause mortality could be disentangled into opposite effects of body fat and fat-free mass (FFM). Research Methods and Procedures: All-cause mortality was studied in the Danish follow-up study ?Diet, Cancer and Health? with 27, 178 men and 29, 875 women 50 to 64 years old recruited from 1993 to 1997. By the end of year 2001, the median follow-up was 5.8 years, and 1851 had died. Body composition was assessed by bioelectrical impedance. Cox regression models were used to estimate the relationships among body fat mass index (body fat mass divided by height squared), FFM index (FFM divided by height squared), and mortality. All analyses were adjusted for smoking habits. Results: Men and women showed similar associations. J-shaped associations were found between body fat mass index and mortality adjusted for FFM and smoking. The mortality rate ratios in the upper part of body fat mass were 1.12 per kg/m2 (95{\%} confidence interval: 1.07, 1.18) in men and 1.06 per kg/m2 (95{\%} confidence interval: 1.02, 1.10) in women. Reversed J-shaped associations were found between FFM index and mortality with a tendency to level off for high values of FFM. Discussion: Our findings suggest that BMI represents joint but opposite associations of body fat and FFM with mortality. Both high body fat and low FFM are independent predictors of all-cause mortality.},

abstract = {Adiponectin is the most abundant peptide secreted by adipocytes, whose reduction plays a central role in obesity-related diseases, including insulin resistance/type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. In addition to adipocytes, other cell types, such as skeletal and cardiac myocytes and endothelial cells, can also produce this adipocytokine. Adiponectin effects are mediated by adiponectin receptors, which occur as two isoforms (AdipoR1 and AdipoR2). Adiponectin has direct actions in liver, skeletal muscle, and the vasculature.Adiponectin exists in the circulation as varying molecular weight forms, produced by multimerization. Several endoplasmic reticulum ER-associated proteins, including ER oxidoreductase 1-$\alpha$ (Ero1-$\alpha$), ER resident protein 44 (ERp44), disulfide-bond A oxidoreductase-like protein (DsbA-L), and glucose-regulated protein 94 (GPR94), have recently been found to be involved in the assembly and secretion of higher-order adiponectin complexes. Recent data indicate that the high-molecular weight (HMW) complexes have the predominant action in metabolic tissues. Studies have shown that adiponectin administration in humans and rodents has insulin-sensitizing, anti-atherogenic, and anti-inflammatory effects, and, in certain settings, also decreases body weight. Therefore, adiponectin replacement therapy in humans may suggest potential versatile therapeutic targets in the treatment of obesity, insulin resistance/type 2 diabetes, and atherosclerosis. The current knowledge on regulation and function of adiponectin in obesity, insulin resistance, and cardiovascular disease is summarized in this review.},

abstract = {Genetic predictions of height differ among human populations and these differences have been interpreted as evidence of polygenic adaptation. These differences were first detected using SNPs genome-wide significantly associated with height, and shown to grow stronger when large numbers of sub-significant SNPs were included, leading to excitement about the prospect of analyzing large fractions of the genome to detect polygenic adaptation for multiple traits. Previous studies of height have been based on SNP effect size measurements in the GIANT Consortium meta-analysis. Here we repeat the analyses in the UK Biobank, a much more homogeneously designed study. We show that polygenic adaptation signals based on large numbers of SNPs below genome-wide significance are extremely sensitive to biases due to uncorrected population stratification. More generally, our results imply that typical constructions of polygenic scores are sensitive to population stratification and that population-level differences should be interpreted with caution.

abstract = {Adiponectin is strongly inversely associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, but its causal role remains controversial. We used a Mendelian randomization approach to test the hypothesis that adiponectin causally influences insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. We used genetic variants at the ADIPOQ gene as instruments to calculate a regression slope between adiponectin levels and metabolic traits (up to 31,000 individuals) and a combination of instrumental variables and summary statistics–based genetic risk scores to test the associations with gold-standard measures of insulin sensitivity (2,969 individuals) and type 2 diabetes (15,960 case subjects and 64,731 control subjects). In conventional regression analyses, a 1-SD decrease in adiponectin levels was correlated with a 0.31-SD (95{\%} CI 0.26–0.35) increase in fasting insulin, a 0.34-SD (0.30–0.38) decrease in insulin sensitivity, and a type 2 diabetes odds ratio (OR) of 1.75 (1.47–2.13). The instrumental variable analysis revealed no evidence of a causal association between genetically lower circulating adiponectin and higher fasting insulin (0.02 SD; 95{\%} CI −0.07 to 0.11; N = 29,771), nominal evidence of a causal relationship with lower insulin sensitivity (−0.20 SD; 95{\%} CI −0.38 to −0.02; N = 1,860), and no evidence of a relationship with type 2 diabetes (OR 0.94; 95{\%} CI 0.75–1.19; N = 2,777 case subjects and 13,011 control subjects). Using the ADIPOQ summary statistics genetic risk scores, we found no evidence of an association between adiponectin-lowering alleles and insulin sensitivity (effect per weighted adiponectin-lowering allele: −0.03 SD; 95{\%} CI −0.07 to 0.01; N = 2,969) or type 2 diabetes (OR per weighted adiponectin-lowering allele: 0.99; 95{\%} CI 0.95–1.04; 15,960 case subjects vs. 64,731 control subjects). These results do not provide any consistent evidence that interventions aimed at increasing adiponectin levels will improve insulin sensitivity or risk of type 2 diabetes.},

Despite decades of science documenting weight stigma, its public health implications are widely ignored. Instead, obese persons are blamed for their weight, with common perceptions that weight stigmatization is justifiable and may motivate individuals to adopt healthier behaviors. We examine evidence to address these assumptions and discuss their public health implications. On the basis of current findings, we propose that weight stigma is not a beneficial public health tool for reducing obesity. Rather, stigmatization of obese individuals threatens health, generates health disparities, and interferes with effective obesity intervention efforts.

abstract = {The "metabolic syndrome" (MetS) is a clustering of components that reflect overnutrition, sedentary lifestyles, and resultant excess adiposity. The MetS includes the clustering of abdominal obesity, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and elevated blood pressure and is associated with other comorbidities including the prothrombotic state, proinflammatory state, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and reproductive disorders. Because the MetS is a cluster of different conditions, and not a single disease, the development of multiple concurrent definitions has resulted. The prevalence of the MetS is increasing to epidemic proportions not only in the United States and the remainder of the urbanized world but also in developing nations. Most studies show that the MetS is associated with an approximate doubling of cardiovascular disease risk and a 5-fold increased risk for incident type 2 diabetes mellitus. Although it is unclear whether there is a unifying pathophysiological mechanism resulting in the MetS, abdominal adiposity and insulin resistance appear to be central to the MetS and its individual components. Lifestyle modification and weight loss should, therefore, be at the core of treating or preventing the MetS and its components. In addition, there is a general consensus that other cardiac risk factors should be aggressively managed in individuals with the MetS. Finally, in 2008 the MetS is an evolving concept that continues to be data driven and evidence based with revisions forthcoming.},

Using Mendelian randomisation (MR), we sought to evaluate associations between polyunsaturated (PUFA), monounsaturated (MUFA) and saturated FAs (SFAs) and CRC risk. METHODS: We analysed genotype data on 9254 CRC cases and 18,386 controls of European ancestry. Externally weighted polygenic risk scores were generated and used to evaluate associations with CRC per one standard deviation increase in genetically defined plasma FA levels. RESULTS: Risk reduction was observed for oleic and palmitoleic MUFAs (OR(OA) = 0.77, 95{\%} CI: 0.65-0.92, P = 3.9 × 10(-3); OR(POA) = 0.36, 95{\%} CI: 0.15-0.84, P = 0.018). PUFAs linoleic and arachidonic acid had negative and positive associations with CRC respectively (OR(LA) = 0.95, 95{\%} CI: 0.93-0.98, P = 3.7 × 10(-4); OR(AA) = 1.05, 95{\%} CI: 1.02-1.07, P = 1.7 × 10(-4)). The SFA stearic acid was associated with increased CRC risk (OR(SA) = 1.17, 95{\%} CI: 1.01-1.35, P = 0.041). CONCLUSION: Results from our analysis are broadly consistent with a pro-inflammatory FA profile having a detrimental effect in terms of CRC risk.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {We propose a method (GREML-LDMS) to estimate heritability for human complex traits in unrelated individuals using whole-genome sequencing data. We demonstrate using simulations based on whole-genome sequencing data that ∼97{\%} and ∼68{\%} of variation at common and rare variants, respectively, can be captured by imputation. Using the GREML-LDMS method, we estimate from 44,126 unrelated individuals that all ∼17 million imputed variants explain 56{\%} (standard error (s.e.) = 2.3{\%}) of variance for height and 27{\%} (s.e. = 2.5{\%}) of variance for body mass index (BMI), and we find evidence that height- and BMI-associated variants have been under natural selection. Considering the imperfect tagging of imputation and potential overestimation of heritability from previous family-based studies, heritability is likely to be 60-70{\%} for height and 30-40{\%} for BMI. Therefore, the missing heritability is small for both traits. For further discovery of genes associated with complex traits, a study design with SNP arrays followed by imputation is more cost-effective than whole-genome sequencing at current prices.},

abstract = {Summary Background Underweight and severe and morbid obesity are associated with highly elevated risks of adverse health outcomes. We estimated trends in mean body-mass index (BMI), which characterises its population distribution, and in the prevalences of a complete set of BMI categories for adults in all countries. Methods We analysed, with use of a consistent protocol, population-based studies that had measured height and weight in adults aged 18 years and older. We applied a Bayesian hierarchical model to these data to estimate trends from 1975 to 2014 in mean BMI and in the prevalences of BMI categories ({\textless}18{\textperiodcentered}5 kg/m2 [underweight], 18{\textperiodcentered}5 kg/m2 to {\textless}20 kg/m2, 20 kg/m2 to {\textless}25 kg/m2, 25 kg/m2 to {\textless}30 kg/m2, 30 kg/m2 to {\textless}35 kg/m2, 35 kg/m2 to {\textless}40 kg/m2, ≥40 kg/m2 [morbid obesity]), by sex in 200 countries and territories, organised in 21 regions. We calculated the posterior probability of meeting the target of halting by 2025 the rise in obesity at its 2010 levels, if post-2000 trends continue. Findings We used 1698 population-based data sources, with more than 19{\textperiodcentered}2 million adult participants (9{\textperiodcentered}9 million men and 9{\textperiodcentered}3 million women) in 186 of 200 countries for which estimates were made. Global age-standardised mean BMI increased from 21{\textperiodcentered}7 kg/m2 (95{\%} credible interval 21{\textperiodcentered}3–22{\textperiodcentered}1) in 1975 to 24{\textperiodcentered}2 kg/m2 (24{\textperiodcentered}0–24{\textperiodcentered}4) in 2014 in men, and from 22{\textperiodcentered}1 kg/m2 (21{\textperiodcentered}7–22{\textperiodcentered}5) in 1975 to 24{\textperiodcentered}4 kg/m2 (24{\textperiodcentered}2–24{\textperiodcentered}6) in 2014 in women. Regional mean BMIs in 2014 for men ranged from 21{\textperiodcentered}4 kg/m2 in central Africa and south Asia to 29{\textperiodcentered}2 kg/m2 (28{\textperiodcentered}6–29{\textperiodcentered}8) in Polynesia and Micronesia; for women the range was from 21{\textperiodcentered}8 kg/m2 (21{\textperiodcentered}4–22{\textperiodcentered}3) in south Asia to 32{\textperiodcentered}2 kg/m2 (31{\textperiodcentered}5–32{\textperiodcentered}8) in Polynesia and Micronesia. Over these four decades, age-standardised global prevalence of underweight decreased from 13{\textperiodcentered}8{\%} (10{\textperiodcentered}5–17{\textperiodcentered}4) to 8{\textperiodcentered}8{\%} (7{\textperiodcentered}4–10{\textperiodcentered}3) in men and from 14{\textperiodcentered}6{\%} (11{\textperiodcentered}6–17{\textperiodcentered}9) to 9{\textperiodcentered}7{\%} (8{\textperiodcentered}3–11{\textperiodcentered}1) in women. South Asia had the highest prevalence of underweight in 2014, 23{\textperiodcentered}4{\%} (17{\textperiodcentered}8–29{\textperiodcentered}2) in men and 24{\textperiodcentered}0{\%} (18{\textperiodcentered}9–29{\textperiodcentered}3) in women. Age-standardised prevalence of obesity increased from 3{\textperiodcentered}2{\%} (2{\textperiodcentered}4–4{\textperiodcentered}1) in 1975 to 10{\textperiodcentered}8{\%} (9{\textperiodcentered}7–12{\textperiodcentered}0) in 2014 in men, and from 6{\textperiodcentered}4{\%} (5{\textperiodcentered}1–7{\textperiodcentered}8) to 14{\textperiodcentered}9{\%} (13{\textperiodcentered}6–16{\textperiodcentered}1) in women. 2{\textperiodcentered}3{\%} (2{\textperiodcentered}0–2{\textperiodcentered}7) of the world's men and 5{\textperiodcentered}0{\%} (4{\textperiodcentered}4–5{\textperiodcentered}6) of women were severely obese (ie, have BMI ≥35 kg/m2). Globally, prevalence of morbid obesity was 0{\textperiodcentered}64{\%} (0{\textperiodcentered}46–0{\textperiodcentered}86) in men and 1{\textperiodcentered}6{\%} (1{\textperiodcentered}3–1{\textperiodcentered}9) in women. Interpretation If post-2000 trends continue, the probability of meeting the global obesity target is virtually zero. Rather, if these trends continue, by 2025, global obesity prevalence will reach 18{\%} in men and surpass 21{\%} in women; severe obesity will surpass 6{\%} in men and 9{\%} in women. Nonetheless, underweight remains prevalent in the world's poorest regions, especially in south Asia. Funding Wellcome Trust, Grand Challenges Canada.},

abstract = {Abstract Introduction and Aims. Understanding how tobacco, alcohol and mental health are related is important for developing population-level policies and individual-level treatments that target comorbidities. The current study aimed to examine sociodemographic characteristics and mental health comorbidities associated with the odds of using tobacco and harmful levels of alcohol concurrently. Design and Methods. Data were drawn from the 45 and Up Study, a large cohort study with 267?153 adults aged 45 years and over in New South Wales, Australia. Participants completed a survey assessing alcohol, smoking, psychological distress, treatment for depression and anxiety, and a range of socioeconomic status indicators. Univariate analyses and three multiple-logistic regression models were used to determine associations with (i) tobacco but not alcohol use; (ii) alcohol but not tobacco use; and (iii) concurrent tobacco and risky levels of alcohol use. Results. Being female, younger, lower individual and area-level socioeconomic status (SES) and depression and psychological distress were associated with tobacco use alone. Factors associated with alcohol use alone were older age, male gender, higher SES, and lower psychological distress and no recent depression treatment. Factors associated with concurrent risky alcohol consumption and tobacco use included being 45?64, being male, less education, earning {\textless}{\$}30?000, being employed, and living in lower-SES areas, treatment for depression, and high distress on the Kessler-10. Discussion and Conclusions. Results suggest strong links between SES, treatment for depression, psychological distress, and concurrent tobacco and alcohol use. This has implications for public health policies and clinical treatment for tobacco and alcohol use, suggesting greater emphasis on addressing multiple health and social concerns.

Mendelian randomization is a powerful way to leverage existing genetic data to investigate causal relationships between risk factors and disease. In recent years, Mendelian randomization has gathered considerable traction in neurodegenerative disease research, providing valuable insights into the aetiology of these conditions. This review aims to evaluate the impact of Mendelian randomization studies on translational medicine for neurodegenerative diseases, highlighting the advances made and challenges faced. We will first describe the fundamental principles and limitations of Mendelian randomization and then discuss the lessons from Mendelian randomization studies of environmental risk factors for neurodegeneration. We will illustrate how Mendelian randomization projects have used novel resources to study molecular pathways of neurodegenerative disease and discuss the emerging role of Mendelian randomization in drug development. Finally, we will conclude with our view of the future of Mendelian randomization in these conditions, underscoring unanswered questions in this field.},

The aim of this study was to systematically review the literature and update evidence concerning persistence of childhood overweight. A computerized bibliographical search ? restricted to studies with a prospective or retrospective longitudinal design ? was conducted. Two authors independently extracted data and assessed the methodological quality of the included studies in four dimensions (i) study population and participation rate; (ii) study attrition; (iii) data collection and (iv) data analysis. Conclusions were based on a rating system of three levels of evidence. A total of 25 publications were selected for inclusion in this review. According to a methodological quality assessment, 13 studies were considered to be of high quality. The majority of these high-quality studies were published after 2001, indicating that recently published data, in particular, provide us with reliable information. All included studies consistently report an increased risk of overweight and obese youth becoming overweight adults, suggesting that the likelihood of persistence of overweight into adulthood is moderate for overweight and obese youth. However, predictive values varied considerably. Limiting aspects with respect to generalizability and methodological issues are discussed.},

abstract = {Intelligence predicts important life and health outcomes, but the biological mechanisms underlying differences in intelligence are not yet understood. The use of genetically determined metabotypes (GDMs) to understand the role of genetic and environmental factors, and their interactions, in human complex traits has been recently proposed. However, this strategy has not been applied to human intelligence. Here we implemented a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis using GDMs to assess the causal relationships between genetically determined metabolites and human intelligence. The standard inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method was used for the primary MR analysis and three additional MR methods (MR-Egger, weighted median, and MR-PRESSO) were used for sensitivity analyses. Using 25 genetic variants as instrumental variables (IVs), our study found that 5-oxoproline was associated with better performance in human intelligence tests (PIVW = 9.25 × 10–5). The causal relationship was robust when sensitivity analyses were applied (PMR-Egger = 0.0001, PWeighted median = 6.29 × 10–6, PMR-PRESSO = 0.0007), and repeated analysis yielded consistent result (PIVW = 0.0087). Similarly, also dihomo-linoleate (20:2n6) and p-acetamidophenylglucuronide showed robust association with intelligence. Our study provides novel insight by integrating genomics and metabolomics to estimate causal effects of genetically determined metabolites on human intelligence, which help to understanding of the biological mechanisms related to human intelligence.},

As a proportion of the total risk reduction, BMI was estimated to mediate 15{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval 13{\%} to 17{\%}) and 18{\%} (14{\%} to 23{\%}) in the observational and mendelian randomisation estimates, respectively. Corresponding estimates were 11{\%} (9{\%} to 13{\%}) and 21{\%} (15{\%} to 27{\%}) for systolic blood pressure and 19{\%} (15{\%} to 22{\%}) and 34{\%} (17{\%} to 50{\%}) for smoking behaviour. All three risk factors combined were estimated to mediate 42{\%} (36{\%} to 48{\%}) and 36{\%} (5{\%} to 68{\%}) of the effect of education on coronary heart disease in observational and mendelian randomisation analyses, respectively. Similar results were obtained when investigating the risk of stroke, myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular disease.Conclusions BMI, systolic blood pressure, and smoking behaviour mediate a substantial proportion of the protective effect of education on the risk of cardiovascular outcomes and intervening on these would lead to reductions in cases of cardiovascular disease attributable to lower levels of education. However, more than half of the protective effect of education remains unexplained and requires further investigation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Youth with high BMI who become nonobese adults have the same cardiovascular risk factor burden as those who were never obese. However, the early-life BMI trajectories for overweight or obese youth who avoid becoming obese adults have not been described. We aimed to determine and compare the young-childhood BMI trajectories of participants according to their BMI status in youth and adulthood.METHODS: Bayesian hierarchical piecewise regression modeling was used to analyze the BMI trajectories of 2717 young adults who had up to 8 measures of BMI from childhood (ages 3–18 years) to adulthood (ages 34–49 years).RESULTS: Compared with those with persistently high BMI, those who resolved their high youth BMI by adulthood had lower average BMI at age 6 years and slower rates of BMI change from young childhood. In addition, their BMI levels started to plateau at 16 years old for females and 21 years old for males, whereas the BMI of those whose high BMI persisted did not stabilize until 25 years old for male subjects and 27 years for female subjects. Compared with those youth who were not overweight or obese and who remained nonobese in adulthood, those who developed obesity had a higher BMI rate of change from 6 years old, and their BMI continued to increase linearly until age 30 years.CONCLUSIONS: Efforts to alter BMI trajectories for adult obesity should ideally commence before age 6 years. The natural resolution of high BMI starts in adolescence for males and early adulthood for females, suggesting a critical window for secondary prevention.},

abstract = {We performed GWAS on 2514 complex traits from the UK Biobank using a linear mixed model, identifying 40,620 independent significant associations (p{\&}lt;5×10−8). We estimate that winner's curse incurs substantial overestimation of effect sizes in a mean of 35{\%} of discovered associations per trait. We use these results to estimate that the polygenicity of most complex traits is below 10000 common causal variants. We evaluated the impact of winner's curse on causal effect estimation and hypothesis testing in Mendelian randomization analyses. We show that winner's curse substantially amplifies the magnitude of weak instrument bias, though any inflation of false discovery rates tends to be low or modest. We designed a process of pseudo-replication within the UK Biobank data to generate GWAS estimates that minimise bias in MR studies using these data. Our resource is integrated into the OpenGWAS platform and enables a convenient framework for researchers to minimise bias or maximise precision of causal effect estimates.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis research was funded in part by the Wellcome Trust and the Royal Society [208806/Z/17/Z] and the UK Medical Research Council (MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit MC{\_}UU{\_}00011/1 and MC{\_}UU{\_}00011/4).

abstract = {Early genome-wide association studies (GWASs) led to the surprising discovery that, for typical complex traits, most of the heritability is due to huge numbers of common variants with tiny effect sizes. Previously, we argued that new models are needed to understand these patterns. Here, we provide a formal model in which genetic contributions to complex traits are partitioned into direct effects from core genes and indirect effects from peripheral genes acting in trans. We propose that most heritability is driven by weak trans-eQTL SNPs, whose effects are mediated through peripheral genes to impact the expression of core genes. In particular, if the core genes for a trait tend to be co-regulated, then the effects of peripheral variation can be amplified such that nearly all of the genetic variance is driven by weak trans effects. Thus, our model proposes a framework for understanding key features of the architecture of complex traits.},

Hazard ratios for incident MI and IHD according to combinations of BMI category and absence or presence of metabolic syndrome.During a median of 3.6 years' follow-up, we recorded 634 incident MI and 1781 incident IHD events. For MI, multivariable adjusted hazard ratios vs normal weight individuals without metabolic syndrome were 1.26 (95{\%} CI, 1.00-1.61) in overweight and 1.88 (95{\%} CI, 1.34-2.63) in obese individuals without metabolic syndrome and 1.39 (95{\%} CI, 0.96-2.02) in normal weight, 1.70 (95{\%} CI, 1.35-2.15) in overweight, and 2.33 (95{\%} CI, 1.81-3.00) in obese individuals with metabolic syndrome. For IHD, results were similar but attenuated. Normal weight vs overweight vs obesity and presence vs absence of metabolic syndrome did not interact on risk of MI or IHD (P = .90 and P = .44). Among individuals both with and without metabolic syndrome there were increasing cumulative incidences of MI and IHD from normal weight through overweight to obese individuals (log-rank trend P = .006 to P {\textless} .001). Although the multivariable adjusted hazard ratio for MI in individuals with vs without metabolic syndrome was 1.54 (95{\%} CI, 1.32-1.81) across all BMI categories, addition of metabolic syndrome to a multivariable model including BMI and other clinical characteristics improved the Harell C-statistic only slightly for risk of MI (comparison P = .03) but not for IHD (P = .41).These findings suggest that overweight and obesity are risk factors for MI and IHD regardless of the presence or absence of metabolic syndrome and that metabolic syndrome is no more valuable than BMI in identifying individuals at risk.},

abstract = {Biomarkers of low-grade inflammation have been associated with susceptibility to a severe infectious disease course, even when measured prior to disease onset. We investigated whether metabolic biomarkers measured by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy could be associated with susceptibility to severe pneumonia (2507 hospitalised or fatal cases) and severe COVID-19 (652 hospitalised cases) in 105,146 generally healthy individuals from UK Biobank, with blood samples collected 2007–2010. The overall signature of metabolic biomarker associations was similar for the risk of severe pneumonia and severe COVID-19. A multi-biomarker score, comprised of 25 proteins, fatty acids, amino acids, and lipids, was associated equally strongly with enhanced susceptibility to severe COVID-19 (odds ratio 2.9 [95{\%}CI 2.1–3.8] for highest vs lowest quintile) and severe pneumonia events occurring 7–11 years after blood sampling (2.6 [1.7–3.9]). However, the risk for severe pneumonia occurring during the first 2 years after blood sampling for people with elevated levels of the multi-biomarker score was over four times higher than for long-term risk (8.0 [4.1–15.6]). If these hypothesis generating findings on increased susceptibility to severe pneumonia during the first few years after blood sampling extend to severe COVID-19, metabolic biomarker profiling could potentially complement existing tools for identifying individuals at high risk. These results provide novel molecular understanding on how metabolic biomarkers reflect the susceptibility to severe COVID-19 and other infections in the general population.},

Leptin, the adipocyte hormone, is well known for its role in the regulation of food intake and energy expenditure. In addition to the regulation of appetite and satiety that recently has attracted much attentions, insight has also been gained into the critical role of leptin in the control of the insulin-glucose axis, peripheral glucose and insulin responsiveness. Since the discovery of leptin, leptin has been taken for its therapeutic potential to obesity and diabetes. Recently, the therapeutic effects of central leptin gene therapy have been reported in insulin-deficient diabetes in obesity animal models such as ob/ob mise, diet-induced obese mice, and insulin-deficient type 1 diabetes mice, and also in patients with inactivating mutations in the leptin gene. Herein, we review the role of leptin in regulating feeding behavior and glucose metabolism and also the therapeutic potential of leptin in obesity and diabetes mellitus.},

Three or more of these individual criteria were present in 123 (33.4{\%}) subjects overall. The prevalence of the metabolic syndrome did not differ significantly between racial/ethnic groups. The prevalence of the metabolic syndrome from lowest to highest quartile of free testosterone concentration was 19.8, 31.3, 46.9, and 35.0{\%}, respectively [P = 0.056 adjusted for body mass index (BMI)]. None of the 52 women with a BMI less than 27.0 kg/m2 had the metabolic syndrome; those in the top BMI quartile were 13.7 times more likely (95{\%} confidence interval, 5.7–33.0) to have the metabolic syndrome compared with those in the lowest quartile. Thirty-eight percent of those with the metabolic syndrome had impaired glucose tolerance compared with 19{\%} without the metabolic syndrome (P {\textless} 0.001).Conclusions: The metabolic syndrome and its individual components are common in PCOS, particularly among women with the highest insulin levels and BMI. Hyperinsulinemia is a likely common pathogenetic factor for both PCOS and the metabolic syndrome.},

However, when using multiple genetic variants from different gene regions in a Mendelian randomization analysis, it is highly implausible that all the genetic variants satisfy the instrumental variable assumptions. This means that a simple instrumental variable analysis alone should not be relied on to give a causal conclusion. In this article, we discuss a range of sensitivity analyses that will either support or question the validity of causal inference from a Mendelian randomization analysis with multiple genetic variants. We focus on sensitivity analyses of greatest practical relevance for ensuring robust causal inferences, and those that can be undertaken using summarized data. Aside from cases in which the justification of the instrumental variable assumptions is supported by strong biological understanding, a Mendelian randomization analysis in which no assessment of the robustness of the findings to violations of the instrumental variable assumptions has been made should be viewed as speculative and incomplete. In particular, Mendelian randomization investigations with large numbers of genetic variants without such sensitivity analyses should be treated with skepticism.},

abstract = {Multivariable Mendelian randomization (MVMR) is a form of instrumental variable analysis which estimates the direct effect of multiple exposures on an outcome using genetic variants as instruments. Mendelian randomization and MVMR are frequently conducted using two-sample summary data where the association of the genetic variants with the exposures and outcome are obtained from separate samples. If the genetic variants are only weakly associated with the exposures either individually or conditionally, given the other exposures in the model, then standard inverse variance weighting will yield biased estimates for the effect of each exposure. Here, we develop a two-sample conditional F-statistic to test whether the genetic variants strongly predict each exposure conditional on the other exposures included in a MVMR model. We show formally that this test is equivalent to the individual level data conditional F-statistic, indicating that conventional rule-of-thumb critical values of F{\textgreater} 10, can be used to test for weak instruments. We then demonstrate how reliable estimates of the causal effect of each exposure on the outcome can be obtained in the presence of weak instruments and pleiotropy, by repurposing a commonly used heterogeneity Q-statistic as an estimating equation. Furthermore, the minimized value of this Q-statistic yields an exact test for heterogeneity due to pleiotropy. We illustrate our methods with an application to estimate the causal effect of blood lipid fractions on age-related macular degeneration.},

Our aim was to study the informativeness of indices of blood pressure, obesity and serum lipids associated with ischaemic heart disease mortality in a large, homogeneous population. Blood pressure, weight, height, waist and hip circumference, total and HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides were measured at baseline (1995-1997) in 28,158 men and 32,573 women. Information on deaths from ischaemic heart disease (IHD) was obtained from the Causes of Death Registry in Norway from baseline until the end of 2007. Informativeness was analysed using the difference in twice the log-likelihood of a Cox model with and without each index. During 11 years of follow-up, 597 men and 418 women had died from IHD. Systolic blood pressure in men and pulse pressure in women were the most informative predictors of blood pressure, and waist-to-hip ratio adjusted for BMI was the most informative expression of obesity in both men and women. Among serum lipids, the most informative predictor was the ratio of total cholesterol to HDL cholesterol. Using more informative expressions of conventional risk factors for ischemic heart disease may improve both the validity and precision of estimates of risk, and may be useful both clinically and for preventive purposes.},

abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Estimates of the relative mortality risks associated with normal weight, overweight, and obesity may help to inform decision making in the clinical setting. OBJECTIVE: To perform a systematic review of reported hazard ratios (HRs) of all-cause mortality for overweight and obesity relative to normal weight in the general population. DATA SOURCES: PubMed and EMBASE electronic databases were searched through September 30, 2012, without language restrictions. STUDY SELECTION: Articles that reported HRs for all-cause mortality using standard body mass index (BMI) categories from prospective studies of general populations of adults were selected by consensus among multiple reviewers. Studies were excluded that used nonstandard categories or that were limited to adolescents or to those with specific medical conditions or to those undergoing specific procedures. PubMed searches yielded 7034 articles, of which 141 (2.0{\%}) were eligible. An EMBASE search yielded 2 additional articles. After eliminating overlap, 97 studies were retained for analysis, providing a combined sample size of more than 2.88 million individuals and more than 270,000 deaths. DATA EXTRACTION: Data were extracted by 1 reviewer and then reviewed by 3 independent reviewers. We selected the most complex model available for the full sample and used a variety of sensitivity analyses to address issues of possible overadjustment (adjusted for factors in causal pathway) or underadjustment (not adjusted for at least age, sex, and smoking). RESULTS: Random-effects summary all-cause mortality HRs for overweight (BMI of 25-{\textless}30), obesity (BMI of ≥30), grade 1 obesity (BMI of 30-{\textless}35), and grades 2 and 3 obesity (BMI of ≥35) were calculated relative to normal weight (BMI of 18.5-{\textless}25). The summary HRs were 0.94 (95{\%} CI, 0.91-0.96) for overweight, 1.18 (95{\%} CI, 1.12-1.25) for obesity (all grades combined), 0.95 (95{\%} CI, 0.88-1.01) for grade 1 obesity, and 1.29 (95{\%} CI, 1.18-1.41) for grades 2 and 3 obesity. These findings persisted when limited to studies with measured weight and height that were considered to be adequately adjusted. The HRs tended to be higher when weight and height were self-reported rather than measured. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Relative to normal weight, both obesity (all grades) and grades 2 and 3 obesity were associated with significantly higher all-cause mortality. Grade 1 obesity overall was not associated with higher mortality, and overweight was associated with significantly lower all-cause mortality. The use of predefined standard BMI groupings can facilitate between-study comparisons.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Clinical, pathological and genetic overlap between sporadic  frontotemporal dementia (FTD), Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) has been suggested; however, the relationship between these disorders is still not well understood. Here we evaluated genetic overlap between FTD, AD and PD to assess shared pathobiology and identify novel genetic variants associated with increased risk for FTD. METHODS: Summary statistics were obtained from the International FTD Genomics Consortium, International PD Genetics Consortium and International Genomics of AD Project (n{\textgreater}75 000 cases and controls). We used conjunction false discovery rate (FDR) to evaluate genetic pleiotropy and conditional FDR to identify novel FTD-associated SNPs. Relevant variants were further evaluated for expression quantitative loci. RESULTS: We observed SNPs within the HLA, MAPT and APOE regions jointly contributing to increased risk for FTD and AD or PD. By conditioning on polymorphisms associated with PD and AD, we found 11 loci associated with increased risk for FTD. Meta-analysis across two independent FTD cohorts revealed a genome-wide signal within the APOE region (rs6857, 3'-UTR=PVRL2, p=2.21×10(-12)), and a suggestive signal for rs1358071 within the MAPT region (intronic=CRHR1, p=4.91×10(-7)) with the effect allele tagging the H1 haplotype. Pleiotropic SNPs at the HLA and MAPT loci associated with expression changes in cis-genes supporting involvement of intracellular vesicular trafficking, immune response and endo/lysosomal processes. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate genetic pleiotropy in these neurodegenerative diseases and indicate that sporadic FTD is a polygenic disorder where multiple pleiotropic loci with small effects contribute to increased disease risk.},

South Asians (SA) compared to White Europeans (WE) have more fat mass and are more insulin-resistant at a given body mass index (BMI). Whether these are reflected in other gestational metabolomic differences is unclear. Our aim was to compare gestational metabolic profiles and their determinants between WE and SA women. We used data from a United Kingdom (UK) cohort to compare metabolic profiles and associations of maternal age, education, parity, height, BMI, tricep skinfold thickness, gestational diabetes (GD), pre-eclampsia, and gestational hypertension with 156 metabolic measurements in WE (n = 4072) and SA (n = 4702) women. Metabolic profiles, measured in fasting serum taken between 26-28 weeks gestation, were quantified by nuclear magnetic resonance. Distributions of most metabolic measures differed by ethnicity. WE women had higher levels of most lipoprotein subclasses, cholesterol, glycerides and phospholipids, monosaturated fatty acids, and creatinine but lower levels of glucose, linoleic acid, omega-6 and polyunsaturated fatty acids, and most amino acids. Higher BMI and having GD were associated with higher levels of several lipoprotein subclasses, triglycerides, and other metabolites, mostly with stronger associations in WEs. We have shown differences in gestational metabolic profiles between WE and SA women and demonstrated that associations of exposures with these metabolites differ by ethnicity.},

abstract = {It is now recognized that the low-grade inflammation observed with obesity is associated with the development of a wide range of downstream complications. As such, there is considerable interest in elucidating the regulatory mechanisms underlying the production of inflammatory molecules to improve the prevention and treatment of obesity and its co-morbidities. White adipose tissue is no longer considered a passive reservoir for storing lipids, but rather an important organ influencing energy metabolism, insulin sensitivity and inflammation by the secretion of proteins, commonly referred to as adipokines. Dysregulation of several adipokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-$\alpha$), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and adiponectin, contributes to the low-grade inflammation that is a hallmark of obesity. Evidence now suggests that fatty acids represent a class of molecules that can modulate adipokine production, thereby influencing inflammatory status. Although the precise molecular mechanisms by which dietary fats regulate adipokine production remain unclear, recent findings indicate that diet–gene interactions may have an important role in the transcriptional and secretory regulation of adipokines. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the genes encoding TNF-$\alpha$, IL-6 and adiponectin can modify circulating levels of these adipokines and, subsequently, obesity-related phenotypes. This genetic variation can also alter the influence of dietary fatty acids on adipokine production. Therefore, the current review will show that it is paramount to consider both genetic information and dietary fat intake to unravel the inter-individual variability in inflammatory response observed in intervention protocols targeting obesity.},

Body mass index was calculated from measured height and weight; percent fat, percent trunk fat, and appendicular lean mass were measured with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Pearson partial correlations between body composition measures and metabolites were adjusted for age, study site, and smoking. Out of 350 metabolites, body mass index, percent fat, percent trunk fat, and appendicular lean mass were significantly correlated with 92, 48, 96, and 43 metabolites at p less than .0014. Metabolites most strongly correlated with body composition included carnitine, a marker of fatty acid oxidation (positively correlated), triacylglycerols (positively correlated), and amino acids including branched-chain amino acids (positively correlated except for acetylglycine and serine). Gaussian Graphical Models of metabolites found that 25 lipid metabolites clustered into a single network. Groups of five amino acids, three plasmalogens, and two carnitines were also observed. Findings confirm prior reports of associations between amino acids, lean mass, and fat mass in addition to associations not previously reported. Future studies should consider whether these metabolites are relevant for metabolic disease processes.},

abstract = {Mendelian randomization (MR) is a powerful tool in epidemiology that can be used to estimate the causal effect of an exposure on an outcome in the presence of unobserved confounding, by utilizing genetic variants that are instrumental variables (IVs) for the exposure. This has been extended to multivariable MR (MVMR) to estimate the effect of two or more exposures on an outcome.We use simulations and theory to clarify the interpretation of estimated effects in a MVMR analysis under a range of underlying scenarios, where a secondary exposure acts variously as a confounder, a mediator, a pleiotropic pathway and a collider. We then describe how instrument strength and validity can be assessed for an MVMR analysis in the single-sample setting, and develop tests to assess these assumptions in the popular two-sample summary data setting. We illustrate our methods using data from UK Biobank to estimate the effect of education and cognitive ability on body mass index.MVMR analysis consistently estimates the direct causal effect of an exposure, or exposures, of interest and provides a powerful tool for determining causal effects in a wide range of scenarios with either individual- or summary-level data.},

abstract = {Background: Circulating blood lipids cause coronary heart disease (CHD). However, the precise way in which one or more lipoprotein lipid-related entities account for this relationship remains unclear. We sought to explore the causal relationships of blood lipid traits with risk of CHD using multivariable Mendelian randomization. Methods: We conducted GWAS of circulating blood lipid traits in UK Biobank (up to n=440,546) for LDL cholesterol, triglycerides and apolipoprotein B to identify lipid-associated SNPs. Using data from CARDIoGRAMplusC4D for CHD (consisting of 60,801 cases and 123,504 controls), we performed univariable and multivariable Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses. Similar analyses were conducted for HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I. Findings: GWAS identified multiple independent SNPs associated at P{\&}lt;5x10-8 for LDL cholesterol (220), apolipoprotein B (n=255), triglycerides (440), HDL cholesterol (534) and apolipoprotein AI (440). Between 56-93{\%} of SNPs identified for each lipid trait had not been previously reported in large-scale GWAS. Almost half (46{\%}) of these SNPs were associated at P{\&}lt;5x10-8 with more than one lipid related trait. Assessed individually using MR, each of LDL cholesterol (OR 1.66 per 1 standard deviation higher trait; 95{\%}CI: 1.49; 1.86; P=2.4x10-19), triglycerides (OR 1.34; 95{\%}CI: 1.25, 1.44; P=9.1x10-16) and apolipoprotein B (OR 1.73; 95{\%}CI: 1.56, 1.91; P=1.5x10-25) had effect estimates consistent with a higher risk of CHD. In multivariable MR, only apolipoprotein B (OR 1.92; 95{\%}CI: 1.31, 2.81; P=7.5x10-4) retained a robust effect with the estimate for LDL cholesterol (OR 0.85; 95{\%}CI: 0.57; 1.27; P=0.44) reversing and that of triglycerides (OR 1.12; 95{\%}CI: 1.02, 1.23; P=0.01) becoming markedly weaker. Individual MR analyses showed a 1-SD higher HDL-C (OR 0.80; 95{\%}CI: 0.75, 0.86; P=1.7x10-10) and apolipoprotein A-I (OR 0.83; 95{\%}CI: 0.77, 0.89; P=1.0x10-6) to lower the risk of CHD but these effect estimates weakened to include the null on accounting for apolipoprotein B. Conclusions: Apolipoprotein B is of fundamental causal relevance in the aetiology of CHD, and underlies the relationship of LDL cholesterol and triglycerides with CHD.Competing Interest StatementBAF reported receiving personal fees from Merck {\&}amp; Co., Amgen, Regeneron, Sanofi, Pfizer, CiVi BioPhama, and KrKA Phamaceuticals, and grants from Merck {\&}amp; Co., Amgen, Novartis and Esperion Therapeutics.

Seven studies were included in the systematic review, and 5 studies with 881 692 participants were eligible to be included in the meta-analysis. Pooled estimates revealed that obesity was significantly associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes (OR, 1.67; 95{\%} CI, 1.30-2.14; P {\textless} .001; I2 = 93{\%}) and coronary artery disease (OR, 1.20; 95{\%} CI, 1.02-1.41; P = .03; I2 = 87{\%}). No association between obesity and stroke was found (OR, 1.02; 95{\%} CI, 0.95-1.09; P = .65; I2 = 0{\%}).The present meta-analysis suggests that obesity is associated with type 2 diabetes and coronary artery disease. Although this analysis of mendelian randomization studies does not prove causality, it is supportive of a causal association.

@article{Bowden2015,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The number of Mendelian randomization analyses including large numbers of genetic variants is rapidly increasing. This is due to the proliferation of genome-wide association studies, and the desire to obtain more precise estimates of causal effects. However, some genetic variants may not be valid instrumental variables, in particular due to them having more than one proximal phenotypic correlate (pleiotropy). METHODS: We view Mendelian randomization with multiple instruments as a meta-analysis, and show that bias caused by pleiotropy can be regarded as analogous to small study bias. Causal estimates using each instrument can be displayed visually by a funnel plot to assess potential asymmetry. Egger regression, a tool to detect small study bias in meta-analysis, can be adapted to test for bias from pleiotropy, and the slope coefficient from Egger regression provides an estimate of the causal effect. Under the assumption that the association of each genetic variant with the exposure is independent of the pleiotropic effect of the variant (not via the exposure), Egger's test gives a valid test of the null causal hypothesis and a consistent causal effect estimate even when all the genetic variants are invalid instrumental variables. RESULTS: We illustrate the use of this approach by re-analysing two published Mendelian randomization studies of the causal effect of height on lung function, and the causal effect of blood pressure on coronary artery disease risk. The conservative nature of this approach is illustrated with these examples. CONCLUSIONS: An adaption of Egger regression (which we call MR-Egger) can detect some violations of the standard instrumental variable assumptions, and provide an effect estimate which is not subject to these violations. The approach provides a sensitivity analysis for the robustness of the findings from a Mendelian randomization investigation.},

Missing metabolites were imputed. We related metabolites (dependent variable) to BMI and BF (independent variable) separately using linear regression. The models were additionally adjusted for covariates. We found 10 metabolites associated with both BMI and BF. We additionally found 11 metabolites associated with only BF, and nine with only BMI. None of these associations was in females. We observed a strong sexual dimorphism in the relationship between body composition and the urine metabolome.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The association between adiposity and cardiometabolic traits is well known from epidemiological studies. Whilst the causal relationship is clear for some of these traits, for others it is not. We aimed to determine whether adiposity is causally related to various cardiometabolic traits using the Mendelian randomization approach. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used the adiposity-associated variant rs9939609 at the FTO locus as an instrumental variable (IV) for body mass index (BMI) in a Mendelian randomization design. Thirty-six population-based studies of individuals of European descent contributed to the analyses. Age- and sex-adjusted regression models were fitted to test for association between (i) rs9939609 and BMI (n = 198,502), (ii) rs9939609 and 24 traits, and (iii) BMI and 24 traits. The causal effect of BMI on the outcome measures was quantified by IV estimators. The estimators were compared to the BMI-trait associations derived from the same individuals. In the IV analysis, we demonstrated novel evidence for a causal relationship between adiposity and incident heart failure (hazard ratio, 1.19 per BMI-unit increase; 95{\%} CI, 1.03-1.39) and replicated earlier reports of a causal association with type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, dyslipidemia, and hypertension (odds ratio for IV estimator, 1.1-1.4; all p {\textless} 0.05). For quantitative traits, our results provide novel evidence for a causal effect of adiposity on the liver enzymes alanine aminotransferase and gamma-glutamyl transferase and confirm previous reports of a causal effect of adiposity on systolic and diastolic blood pressure, fasting insulin, 2-h post-load glucose from the oral glucose tolerance test, C-reactive protein, triglycerides, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (all p {\textless} 0.05). The estimated causal effects were in agreement with traditional observational measures in all instances except for type 2 diabetes, where the causal estimate was larger than the observational estimate (p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: We provide novel evidence for a causal relationship between adiposity and heart failure as well as between adiposity and increased liver enzymes.},

abstract = {The amount of abdominal visceral adipose tissue measured by computed tomography is a critical correlate of the potentially “atherogenic” metabolic disturbances associated with abdominal obesity. In this study conducted in samples of 81 men and 70 women, data are presented on the anthropornetric correlates of abdominal visceral adipose tissue accumulation and related cardiovascular disease risk factors (trigiyceride and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, fasting and postglucose insulin and glucose levels). Results indicate that the waist circumference and the abdominal sagittal diameter are better correlates of abdominal visceral adipose tissue accumulation than the commonly used waist-to-hip ratio (WHR). In women, the waist circumference and the abdominal sagittal diameter also appeared more closely related to the metabolic variables than the WHR. When the samples were divided into quintiles of waist circumference, WHR or abdominal sagittal diameter, it was noted that increasing values of waist circumference and abdominal sagittal diameter were more consistently associated with increases in fasting and postglucose insulin levels than increasing values of WHR, especially in women. These findings suggest that the waist circumference or the abdominal sagittal diameter, rather than the WHR, should be used as indexes of abdominal visceral adipose tissue deposition and in the assessment of cardiovascular risk. It is suggested from these data that waist circumference values above approximately 100 cm, or abdominal sagittal diameter values {\textgreater}25 cm are most likely to be associated with potentially “atherogenic” metabolic disturbances.},

The aim of this cross-sectional study is to investigate the influence of fasting regarding the association between dietary patterns, reflected by macro- and micronutrient intake, and human serum metabolites in a population-based cohort. A total 1197 non-diabetic German adults aged 45 to 83 years, who participated in baseline of the CARLA study 2002–2006 and had metabolite quantification were selected for this study. Macro- and micronutrient intakes were estimated from a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Concentrations of 134 serum metabolites were measured by targeted metabolomics AbsoluteIDQ p150 Kit. The association of dietary patterns with serum metabolites was calculated by means of linear regression and the influence of the fasting status was considered by including interaction terms with each macro- and micronutrient. Higher self-reported intake of alcohol and lower self-reported intake of organic acids were associated with higher concentrations of acylcarnitines and phosphatidylcholines. Mainly the associations between dietary patterns and acylcarnitines and hexose were altered after including interaction terms, suggesting effect modification by fasting status. No effect from fasting time was seen for amino acids and saturated, mono- and polyunsaturated phosphatidylcholines.},

abstract = {Because leptin reduces food intake and body weight, the coexistence of elevated leptin levels with obesity is widely interpreted as evidence of 'leptin resistance.' Indeed, obesity promotes a number of cellular processes that attenuate leptin signaling (referred to here as 'cellular leptin resistance') and amplify the extent of weight gain induced by genetic and environmental factors. As commonly used, however, the term 'leptin resistance' embraces a range of phenomena that are distinct in underlying mechanisms and pathophysiological implications. Moreover, the induction of cellular leptin resistance by obesity complicates efforts to distinguish the mechanisms that predispose to weight gain from those that result from it. We suggest a framework for approaching these issues and important avenues for future investigation.},

abstract = {Background: Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is defined by a combination of abnormalities that are all individual risk factors for the development of type 2 diabetes and/or cardiovascular disease. The aetiology of MetS includes both an environmental and genetic component. We studied the prevalence and heritability of MetS and its individual components Dutch genetic isolate.Methods: The Erasmus Rucphen Family study (ERF) consists of some 3000 genealogically documented individuals from a Dutch genetic isolate. Data on waist circumference (WC), blood pressure (BP), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), triglycerides (TG) and fasting plasma glucose values (FPG) are available. MetS was defined according to the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) (2003) and National Cholesterol Education program Adult Panel III (NCEP ATPIII) criteria. Variance component analysis was applied to extended family data to test for evidence of heritability.Results: The prevalence of MetS in the ERF cohort ranged from 23–37{\%} depending on MetS definition and gender considered. Low HDL-C and high WC are the main contributors to MetS. The heritability of MetS corrected for sibship effect was 10.6{\%} (p = 0.01) according to IDF and 13.2{\%} (p = 0.07) according to NCEP ATPIII criteria. In addition, the heritability of individual components of MetS were analysed and found to range from 21.9–42.9{\%}. The highest heritability was found for HDL-C (42.9{\%}, p{\&}lt;0.0001) and WC (37.8{\%}, p{\&}lt;0.0001). In addition, WC, systolic BP, HDL-C and TG showed low to moderate genetic correlation (RhoG) between genders, whereas FPG and diastolic BP showed absolute genetic correlation between genders.Conclusion: Although the prevalence of MetS was high, the heritability of MetS in the ERF population was found to be moderate. The high heritability of the individual components of MetS indicates that the genetic dissection of MetS should be approached from its individual components.},

abstract = {Background. Existing evidence suggests the visceral fat is more metabolically active than subcutaneous fat. We aimed to investigate the value of subcutaneous (SAT) and visceral adipose tissue thickness (VAT) for prediction of gallstone disease (GSD) in general population by focus on gender differences and comparison with body mass index (BMI), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR). Material and methods. In this cross-sectional survey, 1,494 subjects (51.4 {\%} men), aged above 50, randomly selected from Golestan Cohort Study residing in Gonbad City, Iran, underwent anthropometric measurements and abdominal ultrasonography. Results. Prevalence of GSD was 17.8{\%} (95{\%} CI 15.9-19.8). Following adjustment for age and then other potential risk factors, all obesity indices, except for SAT, were associated with GSD in women with the highest odds ratio observed in WHtR (OR 1.52, 95{\%} CI 1.22-1.89). In contrast, WHR was the only associated index in men (OR 1.49, 95{\%} CI 1.08-2.06). The trend of increasing obesity measures across the quartiles with the risk of GSD was significant in subgroups of WHtR and BMI in women and WHR in men. No significant association was found between SAT and GSD in men or women. Conclusions. The best anthropometric indicators of the risk of GSD may differ by gender. In men, WHR might be the only preferred index to estimate risk of GSD. WHtR, WHR, VAT and BMI are associated with GSD risk in women, although WHtR might better explain this risk. SAT is the poor indicator for identifying subjects with GSD in both genders.},

abstract = {Ageing populations may demand more blood transfusions, but the blood supply could be limited by difficulties in attracting and retaining a decreasing pool of younger donors. One approach to increase blood supply is to collect blood more frequently from existing donors. If more donations could be safely collected in this manner at marginal cost, then it would be of considerable benefit to blood services. National Health Service (NHS) Blood and Transplant in England currently allows men to donate up to every 12 weeks and women to donate up to every 16 weeks. In contrast, some other European countries allow donations as frequently as every 8 weeks for men and every 10 weeks for women. The primary aim of the INTERVAL trial is to determine whether donation intervals can be safely and acceptably decreased to optimise blood supply whilst maintaining the health of donors.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: High body-mass index (BMI) predisposes to several site-specific cancers, but a large-scale systematic and detailed characterisation of patterns of risk across all common cancers adjusted for potential confounders has not previously been undertaken. We aimed to investigate the links between BMI and the most common site-specific cancers. METHODS: With primary care data from individuals in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink with BMI data, we fitted Cox models to investigate associations between BMI and 22 of the most common cancers, adjusting for potential confounders. We fitted linear then non-linear (spline) models; investigated effect modification by sex, menopausal status, smoking, and age; and calculated population effects. FINDINGS: 5{\textperiodcentered}24 million individuals were included; 166,955 developed cancers of interest. BMI was associated with 17 of 22 cancers, but effects varied substantially by site. Each 5 kg/m(2) increase in BMI was roughly linearly associated with cancers of the uterus (hazard ratio [HR] 1{\textperiodcentered}62, 99{\%} CI 1{\textperiodcentered}56-1{\textperiodcentered}69; p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001), gallbladder (1{\textperiodcentered}31, 1{\textperiodcentered}12-1{\textperiodcentered}52; p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001), kidney (1{\textperiodcentered}25, 1{\textperiodcentered}17-1{\textperiodcentered}33; p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001), cervix (1{\textperiodcentered}10, 1{\textperiodcentered}03-1{\textperiodcentered}17; p=0{\textperiodcentered}00035), thyroid (1{\textperiodcentered}09, 1{\textperiodcentered}00-1{\textperiodcentered}19; p=0{\textperiodcentered}0088), and leukaemia (1{\textperiodcentered}09, 1{\textperiodcentered}05-1{\textperiodcentered}13; p≤0{\textperiodcentered}0001). BMI was positively associated with liver (1{\textperiodcentered}19, 1{\textperiodcentered}12-1{\textperiodcentered}27), colon (1{\textperiodcentered}10, 1{\textperiodcentered}07-1{\textperiodcentered}13), ovarian (1{\textperiodcentered}09, 1.04-1.14), and postmenopausal breast cancers (1{\textperiodcentered}05, 1{\textperiodcentered}03-1{\textperiodcentered}07) overall (all p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001), but these effects varied by underlying BMI or individual-level characteristics. We estimated inverse associations with prostate and premenopausal breast cancer risk, both overall (prostate 0{\textperiodcentered}98, 0{\textperiodcentered}95-1{\textperiodcentered}00; premenopausal breast cancer 0{\textperiodcentered}89, 0{\textperiodcentered}86-0{\textperiodcentered}92) and in never-smokers (prostate 0{\textperiodcentered}96, 0{\textperiodcentered}93-0{\textperiodcentered}99; premenopausal breast cancer 0{\textperiodcentered}89, 0{\textperiodcentered}85-0{\textperiodcentered}94). By contrast, for lung and oral cavity cancer, we observed no association in never smokers (lung 0{\textperiodcentered}99, 0{\textperiodcentered}93-1{\textperiodcentered}05; oral cavity 1{\textperiodcentered}07, 0{\textperiodcentered}91-1{\textperiodcentered}26): inverse associations overall were driven by current smokers and ex-smokers, probably because of residual confounding by smoking amount. Assuming causality, 41{\%} of uterine and 10{\%} or more of gallbladder, kidney, liver, and colon cancers could be attributable to excess weight. We estimated that a 1 kg/m(2) population-wide increase in BMI would result in 3790 additional annual UK patients developing one of the ten cancers positively associated with BMI. INTERPRETATION: BMI is associated with cancer risk, with substantial population-level effects. The heterogeneity in the effects suggests that different mechanisms are associated with different cancer sites and different patient subgroups.

abstract = {Along with genes and proteins, metabolites play important roles in sustaining life. Their functions include "primary" functions in metabolism and energy storage, as well as "secondary" functions in cell-to-cell signaling, metal acquisition, and virulence. There remains much to be learned about the in vivo roles of metabolites. Approaches that accelerate measurement of metabolite levels directly from cells and tissues should increase our understanding of the diverse roles of metabolites and potentially lead to discovery of novel metabolites and metabolic pathways. Metabolomics is an important comparative tool to study global metabolite levels in samples under various conditions. In this unit, the steps needed to perform a mass spectrometry (MS)--based untargeted metabolomics experiment using bacterial supernatants are detailed. In contrast to a targeted metabolomics experiment, which measures ions from known metabolites, an untargeted metabolomics experiment registers all ions within a certain mass range, including ions belonging to structurally novel metabolites. The protocols in this unit describe the conditions necessary for analyzing hydrophobic metabolites and provide an example of how to structurally characterize a novel metabolite.},

Obes Res. 1998;6:383?392. Objectives: This study examines genetic and behavioral determinants of waist-hip ratio (WHR) and waist circumference among women twins. Research Methods and Procedures: Six hundred eighty participants from the second examination of the Kaiser-Permanente Women Twins Study (1989 to 1990) were included. Women ranged in age from 31 to 90 years, and included 59{\%} monozygotic and 41{\%} dizygotic twins. Heritabilities of WHR and waist circumference were estimated (range = 0 to 1) using three different statistical methods. Linear regression models that adjusted for the lack of independence within twin pairs were used to assess associations between behavioral variables, WHR, and waist circumference. Results: Age and body mass index-adjusted heritability estimates ranged from 0.36 to 0.61 for WHR and 0.72 to 0.82 for waist circumference. When considered individually, after adjusting for age and body mass index, all behavioral characteristics, except calorie-adjusted fat intake, were significantly (p{\textless}0.10) associated with waist circumference and WHR. Greater central adiposity was associated with lower education, higher alcohol consumption, lower physical activity, current cigarette smoking, higher parity, and postmenopausal status without hormone replacement therapy. In multivariate models, these associations persisted, except neither educational attainment nor alcohol intake was significantly associated with waist circumference. In longitudinal analyses, both measures were positively associated with current or recent-past smoking; infrequent or inconsistent physical activity; and long-term, daily consumption of alcohol. Discussion: These cross-sectional and longitudinal associations are consistent with genetic and behavioral predictors of waist circumference and WHR. Whereas the evidence for genetic influences is stronger for waist circumference, both body fat measures may be similarly influenced by the behavioral factors considered.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent studies have shown that both female and male obesity may delay time-to-pregnancy (TTP). Little is known about central adiposity or weight gain and fecundability in women. METHODS: We examined the association between anthropometric factors and TTP among 1651 Danish women participating in an internet-based prospective cohort study of pregnancy planners (2007-2008). We categorized body mass index (BMI = kg/m(2)) as underweight ({\textless}20), normal weight (20-24), overweight (25-29), obese (30-34) and very obese ({\textgreater} or =35). We used discrete-time Cox regression to estimate fecundability ratios (FRs) and 95{\%} confidence intervals (CI), controlling for potential confounders. RESULTS: We found longer TTPs for overweight (FR = 0.83, 95{\%} CI = 0.70-1.00), obese (FR = 0.75, 95{\%} CI = 0.58-0.97), and very obese (FR = 0.61, 95{\%} CI = 0.42-0.88) women, compared with normal weight women. After further control for waist circumference, FRs for overweight, obese, and very obese women were 0.72 (95{\%} CI = 0.58-0.90), 0.60 (95{\%} CI = 0.42-0.85) and 0.48 (95{\%} CI = 0.31-0.74), respectively. Underweight was associated with reduced fecundability among nulliparous women (FR = 0.82, 95{\%} CI = 0.63-1.06) and increased fecundability among parous women (FR = 1.61, 95{\%} CI = 1.08-2.39). Male BMI was not materially associated with TTP after control for female BMI. Compared with women who maintained a stable weight since age 17 (-5 to 4 kg), women who gained {\textgreater} or =15 kg had longer TTPs (FR = 0.72, 95{\%} CI = 0.59-0.88) after adjustment for BMI at age 17. Associations of waist circumference and waist-to-hip ratio with TTP depended on adjustment for female BMI: null associations were observed before adjustment for BMI and weakly positive associations were observed after adjustment for BMI. CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm previous studies showing reduced fertility in overweight and obese women. The association between underweight and fecundability varied by parity.},

Obesity-associated adipose tissue inflammation is a major cause of the decreased insulin sensitivity seen in type 2 diabetes. Recent studies have shed light on the cross-talk between the immune system and organismal metabolism. This review discusses the connection between inflammation in adipose tissue and systemic insulin resistance, focusing on the roles of innate and adaptive immune cell subsets in the pathogenesis of this metabolic disease.},

abstract = {The mechanisms that predispose to hypertension, coronary artery disease (CAD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) in individuals of normal weight are poorly understood. In contrast, in monogenic primary lipodystrophy – a reduction in subcutaneous adipose tissue – it is clear that it is adipose dysfunction that causes severe insulin resistance (IR), hypertension, coronary artery disease and type 2 diabetes. We aimed to test the hypothesis that common alleles associated with insulin resistance also influence the wider clinical and biochemical profile of monogenic insulin resistance. We selected 19 common genetic variants associated with fasting insulin based measures of insulin resistance. We used hierarchical clustering and results from genome wide association studies of 8 non-disease outcomes of monogenic insulin resistance, to group these variants. We analysed genetic risk scores against disease outcomes including 12,171 T2D cases, 40,365 CAD cases and 69,828 individuals with blood pressure measurements. Hierarchical clustering identified 11 variants associated with a metabolic profile consistent with a common, subtle, form of lipodystrophy. A genetic risk score consisting of these 11 IR risk alleles was associated with higher triglycerides ({\ss}=0.018; p=4x10-29), lower HDL cholesterol ({\ss}=-0.020; p=7x10-37), greater hepatic steatosis ({\ss}=0.021; p=3x10-4) higher alanine transaminase ({\ss}=0.002; p=3x10-5), lower SHBG ({\ss}=-0.010; p=9x10-13) and lower adiponectin ({\ss}=-0.015; p=2x10-26). The same risk alleles were associated with lower BMI (per-allele {\ss}=-0.008; p=7x10-8), and increased visceral-to-subcutaneous adipose tissue ratio ({\ss}=-0.015; p=6x10-7). Individuals carrying {\textgreater}= 17 fasting insulin raising alleles (5.5{\%} population) were slimmer (0.30 kgm-2) but at increased risk of T2D (odds ratio [OR] 1.46, per-allele p=5x10-13), CAD (OR 1.12, per-allele p=1x10-5), and increased blood pressure (systolic and diastolic blood pressure of 1.21 mmHg (per-allele p=2x10-5), and 0.67 mmHg (per-allele p=2x10-4), respectively, compared to individuals carrying {\textless}=9 risk alleles (5.5{\%} population). Our results provide genetic evidence for a link between the three diseases of the “metabolic syndrome” and point to reduced subcutaneous adiposity as a central mechanism.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To conduct a systematic review of cross-sectional and prospective human studies evaluating metabolite markers identified using high-throughput metabolomics techniques on prediabetes and type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE databases through August 2015. We conducted a qualitative review of cross-sectional and prospective studies. Additionally, meta-analyses of metabolite markers, with data estimates from at least three prospective studies, and type 2 diabetes risk were conducted, and multivariable-adjusted relative risks of type 2 diabetes were calculated per study-specific SD difference in a given metabolite. RESULTS: We identified 27 cross-sectional and 19 prospective publications reporting associations of metabolites and prediabetes and/or type 2 diabetes. Carbohydrate (glucose and fructose), lipid (phospholipids, sphingomyelins, and triglycerides), and amino acid (branched-chain amino acids, aromatic amino acids, glycine, and glutamine) metabolites were higher in individuals with type 2 diabetes compared with control subjects. Prospective studies provided evidence that blood concentrations of several metabolites, including hexoses, branched-chain amino acids, aromatic amino acids, phospholipids, and triglycerides, were associated with the incidence of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes. We meta-analyzed results from eight prospective studies that reported risk estimates for metabolites and type 2 diabetes, including 8,000 individuals of whom 1,940 had type 2 diabetes. We found 36{\%} higher risk of type 2 diabetes per study-specific SD difference for isoleucine (pooled relative risk 1.36 [1.24-1.48]; I(2) = 9.5{\%}), 36{\%} for leucine (1.36 [1.17-1.58]; I(2) = 37.4{\%}), 35{\%} for valine (1.35 [1.19-1.53]; I(2) = 45.8{\%}), 36{\%} for tyrosine (1.36 [1.19-1.55]; I(2) = 51.6{\%}), and 26{\%} for phenylalanine (1.26 [1.10-1.44]; I(2) = 56{\%}). Glycine and glutamine were inversely associated with type 2 diabetes risk (0.89 [0.81-0.96] and 0.85 [0.82-0.89], respectively; both I(2) = 0.0{\%}). CONCLUSIONS: In studies using high-throughput metabolomics, several blood amino acids appear to be consistently associated with the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.},

abstract = {Background: Anthropometric measures such as the body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference are widely used as convenient indices of adiposity, yet there are limitations in their estimates of body fat. We aimed to determine the prevalence of obesity using criteria based on the BMI and waist circumference, and to examine the relationship between the BMI and body fat. Methodology/Principal Findings: This population-based, cross-sectional study was conducted as part of the Geelong Osteoporosis Study. A random sample of 1,467 men and 1,076 women aged 20-96 years was assessed 2001-2008. Overweight and obesity were identified according to BMI (overweight 25.0-29.9 kg/m 2; obesity ≥30.0 kg/m 2) and waist circumference (overweight men 94.0-101.9 cm; women 80.0-87.9 cm; obesity men ≥102.0 cm, women ≥88.0 cm); body fat mass was assessed using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry; height and weight were measured and lifestyle factors documented by self-report. According to the BMI, 45.1{\%} (95{\%}CI 42.4-47.9) of men and 30.2{\%} (95{\%}CI 27.4-33.0) of women were overweight and a further 20.2{\%} (95{\%}CI 18.0-22.4) of men and 28.6{\%} (95{\%}CI 25.8-31.3) of women were obese. Using waist circumference, 27.5{\%} (95{\%}CI 25.1-30.0) of men and 23.3{\%} (95{\%}CI 20.8-25.9) of women were overweight, and 29.3{\%} (95{\%}CI 26.9-31.7) of men and 44.1{\%} (95{\%}CI 41.2-47.1) of women, obese. Both criteria indicate that approximately 60{\%} of the population exceeded recommended thresholds for healthy body habitus. There was no consistent pattern apparent between BMI and energy intake. Compared with women, BMI overestimated adiposity in men, whose excess weight was largely attributable to muscular body builds and greater bone mass. BMI also underestimated adiposity in the elderly. Regression models including gender, age and BMI explained 0.825 of the variance in percent body fat. Conclusions/Significance: As the BMI does not account for differences in body composition, we suggest that gender- and age-specific thresholds should be considered when the BMI is used to indicate adiposity. {\textcopyright} 2012 Pasco et al.},

In this study, we have analysed 162 PRS (p{\textless}5×10−05) derived from GWAS and 551 heritable traits from the UK Biobank study (N = 334,398). Findings can be investigated using a web application (http:‌//‌mrcieu.‌mrsoftware.org/‌PRS‌{\_}atlas/), which we envisage will help uncover both known and novel mechanisms which contribute towards disease susceptibility. To demonstrate this, we have investigated the results from a phenome-wide evaluation of schizophrenia genetic liability. Amongst findings were inverse associations with measures of cognitive function which extensive follow-up analyses using Mendelian randomization (MR) provided evidence of a causal relationship. We have also investigated the effect of multiple risk factors on disease using mediation and multivariable MR frameworks. Our atlas provides a resource for future endeavours seeking to unravel the causal determinants of complex disease.},

abstract = {Metabolite levels in urine may provide insights into genetic mechanisms shaping their related pathways. We therefore investigate the cumulative contribution of rare, exonic genetic variants on urine levels of 1487 metabolites and 53,714 metabolite ratios among 4864 GCKD study participants. Here we report the detection of 128 significant associations involving 30 unique genes, 16 of which are known to underlie inborn errors of metabolism. The 30 genes are strongly enriched for shared expression in liver and kidney (odds ratio = 65, p-FDR = 3e−7), with hepatocytes and proximal tubule cells as driving cell types. Use of UK Biobank whole-exome sequencing data links genes to diseases connected to the identified metabolites. In silico constraint-based modeling of gene knockouts in a virtual whole-body, organ-resolved metabolic human correctly predicts the observed direction of metabolite changes, highlighting the potential of linking population genetics to modeling. Our study implicates candidate variants and genes for inborn errors of metabolism.},

abstract = {Context: Obese women experience longer times to conception, even if they are young and cycling regularly, which is suggestive of alterations in ovarian function during the periconceptual period.Objective: This study sought to determine whether there are alterations in the preovulatory follicular environment that are likely to influence oocyte developmental competence.Design, Setting, and Participants: Women attending a private infertility clinic were categorized into body mass index (BMI) groups of moderate (n = 33; BMI 20–24.9 kg/m2), overweight (n = 31; BMI 25–29.9 kg/m2), and obese (n =32; BMI ≥30 kg/m2).Intervention: For each patient, follicular fluid was recovered from single follicles at oocyte retrieval, granulosa cells were pooled from multiple follicular aspirates and cumulus cells were pooled after separation from the oocytes.Main Outcome Measures: Follicle fluid was assayed for hormones and metabolites. Granulosa and cumulus cells were analyzed for mRNA expression of insulin signaling components (IRS-2 and Glut4), glucose-regulated genes (ChREBP, ACC, and FAS) and insulin-regulated genes (SREBP-1, CD36, and SR-BI) associated with obesity/insulin resistance.Results: Increasing BMI was associated with increased follicular fluid insulin (P {\textless} 0.001), lactate (P = 0.01), triglycerides (P = 0.0003), and C-reactive protein (P {\textless} 0.0001) as well as decreased SHBG (P = 0.001). IRS-2, Glut4, ChREBP, and SREBP exhibited cell-type-specific expression but were not affected by BMI. CD36 and SRBI mRNA were modestly altered in granulosa cells of obese compared with moderate-weight women.Conclusions: Obese women exhibit an altered ovarian follicular environment, particularly increased metabolite, C-reactive protein, and androgen activity levels, which may be associated with poorer reproductive outcomes typically observed in these patients.},

abstract = {Summary Background Although more than 80{\%} of the global burden of cardiovascular disease occurs in low-income and middle-income countries, knowledge of the importance of risk factors is largely derived from developed countries. Therefore, the effect of such factors on risk of coronary heart disease in most regions of the world is unknown. Methods We established a standardised case-control study of acute myocardial infarction in 52 countries, representing every inhabited continent. 15152 cases and 14820 controls were enrolled. The relation of smoking, history of hypertension or diabetes, waist/hip ratio, dietary patterns, physical activity, consumption of alcohol, blood apolipoproteins (Apo), and psychosocial factors to myocardial infarction are reported here. Odds ratios and their 99{\%} CIs for the association of risk factors to myocardial infarction and their population attributable risks (PAR) were calculated. Findings Smoking (odds ratio 2{\textperiodcentered}87 for current vs never, PAR 35{\textperiodcentered}7{\%} for current and former vs never), raised ApoB/ApoA1 ratio (3{\textperiodcentered}25 for top vs lowest quintile, PAR 49{\textperiodcentered}2{\%} for top four quintiles vs lowest quintile), history of hypertension (1{\textperiodcentered}91, PAR 17{\textperiodcentered}9{\%}), diabetes (2{\textperiodcentered}37, PAR 9{\textperiodcentered}9{\%}), abdominal obesity (1{\textperiodcentered}12 for top vs lowest tertile and 1{\textperiodcentered}62 for middle vs lowest tertile, PAR 20{\textperiodcentered}1{\%} for top two tertiles vs lowest tertile), psychosocial factors (2{\textperiodcentered}67, PAR 32{\textperiodcentered}5{\%}), daily consumption of fruits and vegetables (0{\textperiodcentered}70, PAR 13{\textperiodcentered}7{\%} for lack of daily consumption), regular alcohol consumption (0{\textperiodcentered}91, PAR 6{\textperiodcentered}7{\%}), and regular physical activity (0{\textperiodcentered}86, PAR 12{\textperiodcentered}2{\%}), were all significantly related to acute myocardial infarction (p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001 for all risk factors and p=0{\textperiodcentered}03 for alcohol). These associations were noted in men and women, old and young, and in all regions of the world. Collectively, these nine risk factors accounted for 90{\%} of the PAR in men and 94{\%} in women. Interpretation Abnormal lipids, smoking, hypertension, diabetes, abdominal obesity, psychosocial factors, consumption of fruits, vegetables, and alcohol, and regular physical activity account for most of the risk of myocardial infarction worldwide in both sexes and at all ages in all regions. This finding suggests that approaches to prevention can be based on similar principles worldwide and have the potential to prevent most premature cases of myocardial infarction.

abstract = {CONTEXT: Overweight and obesity are increasing dramatically in the United States and  most likely contribute substantially to the burden of chronic health conditions. OBJECTIVE: To describe the relationship between weight status and prevalence of health conditions by severity of overweight and obesity in the US population. DESIGN AND SETTING: Nationally representative cross-sectional survey using data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III), which was conducted in 2 phases from 1988 to 1994. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 16884 adults, 25 years and older, classified as overweight and obese (body mass index [BMI] {\textgreater} or =25 kg/m2) based on National Institutes of Health recommended guidelines. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus, gallbladder disease, coronary heart disease, high blood cholesterol level, high blood pressure, or osteoarthritis. RESULTS: Sixty-three percent of men and 55{\%} of women had a body mass index of 25 kg/m2 or greater. A graded increase in the prevalence ratio (PR) was observed with increasing severity of overweight and obesity for all of the health outcomes except for coronary heart disease in men and high blood cholesterol level in both men and women. With normal-weight individuals as the reference, for individuals with BMIs of at least 40 kg/m2 and who were younger than 55 years, PRs were highest for type 2 diabetes for men (PR, 18.1; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 6.7-46.8) and women (PR, 12.9; 95{\%} CI, 5.7-28.1) and gallbladder disease for men (PR, 21.1; 95{\%} CI, 4.1-84.2) and women (PR, 5.2; 95{\%} CI, 2.9-8.9). Prevalence ratios generally were greater in younger than in older adults. The prevalence of having 2 or more health conditions increased with weight status category across all racial and ethnic subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: Based on these results, more than half of all US adults are considered overweight or obese. The prevalence of obesity-related comorbidities emphasizes the need for concerted efforts to prevent and treat obesity rather than just its associated comorbidities.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Extensive studies have been carried out to investigate the association  between obesity and the risk of rheumatoid arthritis (RA); however, the results of the current reported original studies remain inconsistent. This study aimed to clarify the relationship between body mass index and rheumatoid arthritis by conducting an updated overall and dose-response meta-analysis. METHODS: The relevant literature was searched using the PubMed and Embase databases (through 20 September 2018) to identify all eligible published studies. Random-effect models and dose-response meta-analyses were used to estimate the pooled risk ratio (RR) with a 95{\%} confidence interval (CI). Subgroup analyses were also conducted based on the characteristics of the participants. Sensitivity analyses and publication bias tests were also performed to explore potential heterogeneity and bias in the meta-analysis. RESULTS: Sixteen studies that included a total of 406,584 participants were included in the meta-analysis. Compared to participants with normal weight, the pooled RRs of rheumatoid arthritis were 1.12 (95{\%} CI, 1.04-1.20) in overweight and 1.23 (95{\%} CI, 1.09-1.39) in obese participants. There was evidence of a nonlinear relationship between body mass index (BMI) and RA (P  for nonlinearity less than 0.001 in the overall meta-analysis, P for nonlinearity=0.025 in the case-control studies, P for nonlinearity=0.0029 in the cohort studies). No significant heterogeneity was found among studies (I (2)=10.9{\%} for overweight and I (2)=45.5{\%} for obesity). CONCLUSION: The overall and dose-response meta-analysis showed that increased BMI was associated with an increased risk for rheumatoid arthritis, which might present a prevention strategy for the prevention or control of rheumatoid arthritis. The nonlinear relationship between BMI and RA might present a personal prevention strategy for RA.},

abstract = {Summary Background Underweight and severe and morbid obesity are associated with highly elevated risks of adverse health outcomes. We estimated trends in mean body-mass index (BMI), which characterises its population distribution, and in the prevalences of a complete set of BMI categories for adults in all countries. Methods We analysed, with use of a consistent protocol, population-based studies that had measured height and weight in adults aged 18 years and older. We applied a Bayesian hierarchical model to these data to estimate trends from 1975 to 2014 in mean BMI and in the prevalences of BMI categories ({\textless}18{\textperiodcentered}5 kg/m2 [underweight], 18{\textperiodcentered}5 kg/m2 to {\textless}20 kg/m2, 20 kg/m2 to {\textless}25 kg/m2, 25 kg/m2 to {\textless}30 kg/m2, 30 kg/m2 to {\textless}35 kg/m2, 35 kg/m2 to {\textless}40 kg/m2, ≥40 kg/m2 [morbid obesity]), by sex in 200 countries and territories, organised in 21 regions. We calculated the posterior probability of meeting the target of halting by 2025 the rise in obesity at its 2010 levels, if post-2000 trends continue. Findings We used 1698 population-based data sources, with more than 19{\textperiodcentered}2 million adult participants (9{\textperiodcentered}9 million men and 9{\textperiodcentered}3 million women) in 186 of 200 countries for which estimates were made. Global age-standardised mean BMI increased from 21{\textperiodcentered}7 kg/m2 (95{\%} credible interval 21{\textperiodcentered}3–22{\textperiodcentered}1) in 1975 to 24{\textperiodcentered}2 kg/m2 (24{\textperiodcentered}0–24{\textperiodcentered}4) in 2014 in men, and from 22{\textperiodcentered}1 kg/m2 (21{\textperiodcentered}7–22{\textperiodcentered}5) in 1975 to 24{\textperiodcentered}4 kg/m2 (24{\textperiodcentered}2–24{\textperiodcentered}6) in 2014 in women. Regional mean BMIs in 2014 for men ranged from 21{\textperiodcentered}4 kg/m2 in central Africa and south Asia to 29{\textperiodcentered}2 kg/m2 (28{\textperiodcentered}6–29{\textperiodcentered}8) in Polynesia and Micronesia; for women the range was from 21{\textperiodcentered}8 kg/m2 (21{\textperiodcentered}4–22{\textperiodcentered}3) in south Asia to 32{\textperiodcentered}2 kg/m2 (31{\textperiodcentered}5–32{\textperiodcentered}8) in Polynesia and Micronesia. Over these four decades, age-standardised global prevalence of underweight decreased from 13{\textperiodcentered}8{\%} (10{\textperiodcentered}5–17{\textperiodcentered}4) to 8{\textperiodcentered}8{\%} (7{\textperiodcentered}4–10{\textperiodcentered}3) in men and from 14{\textperiodcentered}6{\%} (11{\textperiodcentered}6–17{\textperiodcentered}9) to 9{\textperiodcentered}7{\%} (8{\textperiodcentered}3–11{\textperiodcentered}1) in women. South Asia had the highest prevalence of underweight in 2014, 23{\textperiodcentered}4{\%} (17{\textperiodcentered}8–29{\textperiodcentered}2) in men and 24{\textperiodcentered}0{\%} (18{\textperiodcentered}9–29{\textperiodcentered}3) in women. Age-standardised prevalence of obesity increased from 3{\textperiodcentered}2{\%} (2{\textperiodcentered}4–4{\textperiodcentered}1) in 1975 to 10{\textperiodcentered}8{\%} (9{\textperiodcentered}7–12{\textperiodcentered}0) in 2014 in men, and from 6{\textperiodcentered}4{\%} (5{\textperiodcentered}1–7{\textperiodcentered}8) to 14{\textperiodcentered}9{\%} (13{\textperiodcentered}6–16{\textperiodcentered}1) in women. 2{\textperiodcentered}3{\%} (2{\textperiodcentered}0–2{\textperiodcentered}7) of the world's men and 5{\textperiodcentered}0{\%} (4{\textperiodcentered}4–5{\textperiodcentered}6) of women were severely obese (ie, have BMI ≥35 kg/m2). Globally, prevalence of morbid obesity was 0{\textperiodcentered}64{\%} (0{\textperiodcentered}46–0{\textperiodcentered}86) in men and 1{\textperiodcentered}6{\%} (1{\textperiodcentered}3–1{\textperiodcentered}9) in women. Interpretation If post-2000 trends continue, the probability of meeting the global obesity target is virtually zero. Rather, if these trends continue, by 2025, global obesity prevalence will reach 18{\%} in men and surpass 21{\%} in women; severe obesity will surpass 6{\%} in men and 9{\%} in women. Nonetheless, underweight remains prevalent in the world's poorest regions, especially in south Asia. Funding Wellcome Trust, Grand Challenges Canada.},

abstract = {Identification of adipose-specific genes has contributed to an understanding of mechanisms underlying adipocyte development and obesity. Herein, our analyses of the recent Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) database revealed 38 adipose-specific/enhanced protein coding genes, among which 3 genes were novel adipose-specific, and 414 highly differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between subcutaneous and omental adipose depots. By integrative analyses of genome-wide association studies (GWASs), 14 adipose-specific/enhanced genes and 60 DEGs were found to be associated with obesity-related traits and diseases, consolidating evidence for contribution of these genes to the regional fat distribution and obesity phenotypes. In addition, expression of HOXC cluster was up-regulated in subcutaneous adipose tissue, and the majority of the HOXB cluster was expressed highly in omental adipose tissue, indicating differential expression patterns of HOX clusters in adipose depots. Our findings on the distinct gene expression profiles in adipose tissue and their relation to obesity provide an important foundation for future functional biological studies and therapeutic targets in obesity and associated diseases.},

abstract = {Metabolomics is becoming common in epidemiology due to recent developments in quantitative profiling technologies and appealing results from their applications for understanding health and disease. Our team has developed an automated high-throughput serum NMR metabolomics platform that provides quantitative molecular data on 14 lipoprotein subclasses, their lipid concentrations and composition, apolipoprotein A-I and B, multiple cholesterol and triglyceride measures, albumin, various fatty acids as well as on numerous low-molecular-weight metabolites, including amino acids, glycolysis related measures and ketone bodies. The molar concentrations of these measures are obtained from a single serum sample with costs comparable to standard lipid measurements. We have analyzed almost 250 000 samples from around 100 epidemiological cohorts and biobanks and the new international set-up of multiple platforms will allow an annual throughput of more than 250 000 samples. The molecular data have been used to study type 1 and type 2 diabetes etiology as well as to characterize the molecular reflections of the metabolic syndrome, long-term physical activity, diet and lipoprotein metabolism. The results have revealed new biomarkers for early atherosclerosis, type 2 diabetes, diabetic nephropathy, cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality. We have also combined genomics and metabolomics in diverse studies. We envision that quantitative high-throughput NMR metabolomics will be incorporated as a routine in large biobanks; this would make perfect sense both from the biological research and cost point of view - the standard output of over 200 molecular measures would vastly extend the relevance of the sample collections and make many separate clinical chemistry assays redundant.},

abstract = {Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is strongly associated with obesity in most, but not all, ethnic groups, suggesting important ethnic differences in disease susceptibility. Although it is clear that insulin resistance plays a major role in the pathogenesis of T2DM and that insulin resistance is strongly associated with increases in hepatic (HTG) and/or intramyocellular lipid content, little is known about the prevalence of insulin resistance and potential differences in intracellular lipid distribution among healthy, young, lean individuals of different ethnic groups. To examine this question, 482 young, lean, healthy, sedentary, nonsmoking Eastern Asians (n = 49), Asian-Indians (n = 59), Blacks (n = 48), Caucasians (n = 292), and Hispanics (n = 34) underwent an oral glucose tolerance test to assess whole-body insulin sensitivity by an insulin sensitivity index. In addition, intramyocellular lipid and HTG contents were measured by using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The prevalence of insulin resistance, defined as the lower quartile of insulin sensitivity index, was approximately 2- to 3-fold higher in the Asian-Indians compared with all other ethnic groups, and this could entirely be attributed to a 3- to 4-fold increased prevalence of insulin resistance in Asian-Indian men. This increased prevalence of insulin resistance in the Asian-Indian men was associated with an approximately 2-fold increase in HTG content and plasma IL-6 concentrations compared with Caucasian men. These data demonstrate important ethnic and gender differences in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance in Asian-Indian men and have important therapeutic implications for treatment of T2DM and for the development of steatosis-related liver disease in this ethnic group.},

abstract = {Adiponectin is the most abundant peptide secreted by adipocytes, whose reduction plays a central role in obesity-related diseases, including insulin resistance/type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. In addition to adipocytes, other cell types, such as skeletal and cardiac myocytes and endothelial cells, can also produce this adipocytokine. Adiponectin effects are mediated by adiponectin receptors, which occur as two isoforms (AdipoR1 and AdipoR2). Adiponectin has direct actions in liver, skeletal muscle, and the vasculature.Adiponectin exists in the circulation as varying molecular weight forms, produced by multimerization. Several endoplasmic reticulum ER-associated proteins, including ER oxidoreductase 1-$\alpha$ (Ero1-$\alpha$), ER resident protein 44 (ERp44), disulfide-bond A oxidoreductase-like protein (DsbA-L), and glucose-regulated protein 94 (GPR94), have recently been found to be involved in the assembly and secretion of higher-order adiponectin complexes. Recent data indicate that the high-molecular weight (HMW) complexes have the predominant action in metabolic tissues. Studies have shown that adiponectin administration in humans and rodents has insulin-sensitizing, anti-atherogenic, and anti-inflammatory effects, and, in certain settings, also decreases body weight. Therefore, adiponectin replacement therapy in humans may suggest potential versatile therapeutic targets in the treatment of obesity, insulin resistance/type 2 diabetes, and atherosclerosis. The current knowledge on regulation and function of adiponectin in obesity, insulin resistance, and cardiovascular disease is summarized in this review.},

Obesity is also associated with an increased risk for death, particularly among adults younger than 65 years.To update the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) 2012 recommendation on screening for obesity in adults.The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on interventions (behavioral and pharmacotherapy) for weight loss or weight loss maintenance that can be provided in or referred from a primary care setting. Surgical weight loss interventions and nonsurgical weight loss devices (eg, gastric balloons) are considered to be outside the scope of the primary care setting.The USPSTF found adequate evidence that intensive, multicomponent behavioral interventions in adults with obesity can lead to clinically significant improvements in weight status and reduce the incidence of type 2 diabetes among adults with obesity and elevated plasma glucose levels; these interventions are of moderate benefit. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that behavior-based weight loss maintenance interventions are of moderate benefit. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that the harms of intensive, multicomponent behavioral interventions (including weight loss maintenance interventions) in adults with obesity are small to none. Therefore, the USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that offering or referring adults with obesity to intensive behavioral interventions or behavior-based weight loss maintenance interventions has a moderate net benefit.The USPSTF recommends that clinicians offer or refer adults with a body mass index of 30 or higher to intensive, multicomponent behavioral interventions.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sleep traits are associated with cardiometabolic disease risk, with  evidence from Mendelian randomization (MR) suggesting that insomnia symptoms and shorter sleep duration increase coronary artery disease risk. We combined adjusted multivariable regression (AMV) and MR analyses of phenotypes of unfavourable sleep on 113 metabolomic traits to investigate possible biochemical mechanisms linking sleep to cardiovascular disease. METHODS: We used AMV (N = 17,368) combined with two-sample MR (N = 38,618) to examine effects of self-reported insomnia symptoms, total habitual sleep duration, and chronotype on 113 metabolomic traits. The AMV analyses were conducted on data from 10 cohorts of mostly Europeans, adjusted for age, sex, and body mass index. For the MR analyses, we used summary results from published European-ancestry genome-wide association studies of self-reported sleep traits and of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) serum metabolites. We used the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method and complemented this with sensitivity analyses to assess MR assumptions. RESULTS: We found consistent evidence from AMV and MR analyses for associations of usual vs. sometimes/rare/never insomnia symptoms with lower citrate (- 0.08 standard deviation (SD)[95{\%} confidence interval (CI) - 0.12, - 0.03] in AMV and - 0.03SD [- 0.07, - 0.003] in MR), higher glycoprotein acetyls (0.08SD [95{\%} CI 0.03, 0.12] in AMV and 0.06SD [0.03, 0.10) in MR]), lower total very large HDL particles (- 0.04SD [- 0.08, 0.00] in AMV and - 0.05SD [- 0.09, - 0.02] in MR), and lower phospholipids in very large HDL particles (- 0.04SD [- 0.08, 0.002] in AMV and - 0.05SD [- 0.08, - 0.02] in MR). Longer total sleep duration associated with higher creatinine concentrations using both methods (0.02SD per 1 h [0.01, 0.03] in AMV and 0.15SD [0.02, 0.29] in MR) and with isoleucine in MR analyses (0.22SD [0.08, 0.35]). No consistent evidence was observed for effects of chronotype on metabolomic measures. CONCLUSIONS: Whilst our results suggested that unfavourable sleep traits may not cause widespread metabolic disruption, some notable effects were observed. The evidence for possible effects of insomnia symptoms on glycoprotein acetyls and citrate and longer total sleep duration on creatinine and isoleucine might explain some of the effects, found in MR analyses of these sleep traits on coronary heart disease, which warrant further investigation.},

abstract = {Several prospective epidemiological studies have shown that there is a clear inverse relationship between serum high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) concentrations and risk for coronary heart disease (CHD), even at low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels below 70 mg/dL. However, more recent evidence from genetic studies and clinical research has come to challenge the long-standing notion that higher HDL-C levels are always beneficial, while lower HDL-C levels are always detrimental. Thus, it becomes apparent that HDL functionality plays a much more important role in atheroprotection than circulating HDL-C levels. HDL cholesterol efflux capacity (CEC) from macrophages is a key metric of HDL functionality and exhibits a strong inverse association with both carotid intima-media thickness and the likelihood of angiographic coronary artery disease (CAD), independent of the HDL-C level. Thus, extensive research is being conducted to identify new agents with a favorable side effect profile, which would be able to enhance CEC, improve HDL functionality and potentially decrease cardiovascular risk. This review aims to present and discuss the current clinical and scientific evidence pertaining to the significance of HDL functionality over the actual HDL-C concentration in mediating the favorable effects on the cardiovascular system. Thus, we conducted a PubMed search until December 2017 through the English literature using the search terms 'HDL function/functionality', 'HDL properties', 'cardiovascular risk' and 'cholesterol efflux capacity'. We also included references from the articles identified and publications available in the authors' libraries.},

To better understand the mechanisms regulating placental development and gene expression, we characterized the transcriptome of term placenta from 20 healthy women with uncomplicated pregnancies using RNA-seq. To identify genes that were highly expressed and unique to the placenta we compared placental RNA-seq data to data from 7 other tissues (adipose, breast, hear, kidney, liver, lung, and smooth muscle) and identified several genes novel to placental biology (QSOX1, DLG5, and SEMA7A). Semi-quantitative RT-PCR confirmed the RNA-seq results and immunohistochemistry indicated these proteins were highly expressed in the placental syncytium. Additionally, we mined our RNA-seq data to map the relative expression of key developmental gene families (Fox, Sox, Gata, Tead, and Wnt) within the placenta. We identified FOXO4, GATA3, and WNT7A to be amongst the highest expressed members of these families. Overall, these findings provide a new reference for understanding of placental transcriptome and can aid in the identification of novel pathways regulating placenta physiology that may be dysregulated in placental disease.},

abstract = {Abstract Introduction and Aims. Understanding how tobacco, alcohol and mental health are related is important for developing population-level policies and individual-level treatments that target comorbidities. The current study aimed to examine sociodemographic characteristics and mental health comorbidities associated with the odds of using tobacco and harmful levels of alcohol concurrently. Design and Methods. Data were drawn from the 45 and Up Study, a large cohort study with 267?153 adults aged 45 years and over in New South Wales, Australia. Participants completed a survey assessing alcohol, smoking, psychological distress, treatment for depression and anxiety, and a range of socioeconomic status indicators. Univariate analyses and three multiple-logistic regression models were used to determine associations with (i) tobacco but not alcohol use; (ii) alcohol but not tobacco use; and (iii) concurrent tobacco and risky levels of alcohol use. Results. Being female, younger, lower individual and area-level socioeconomic status (SES) and depression and psychological distress were associated with tobacco use alone. Factors associated with alcohol use alone were older age, male gender, higher SES, and lower psychological distress and no recent depression treatment. Factors associated with concurrent risky alcohol consumption and tobacco use included being 45?64, being male, less education, earning {\textless}{\$}30?000, being employed, and living in lower-SES areas, treatment for depression, and high distress on the Kessler-10. Discussion and Conclusions. Results suggest strong links between SES, treatment for depression, psychological distress, and concurrent tobacco and alcohol use. This has implications for public health policies and clinical treatment for tobacco and alcohol use, suggesting greater emphasis on addressing multiple health and social concerns.

To identify genetic variants contributing to differences in hepatic fat content, we carried out a genome-wide association scan of nonsynonymous sequence variations (n = 9,229) in a population comprising Hispanic, African American and European American individuals. An allele in PNPLA3 (rs738409[G], encoding I148M) was strongly associated with increased hepatic fat levels (P = 5.9 x 10(-10)) and with hepatic inflammation (P = 3.7 x 10(-4)). The allele was most common in Hispanics, the group most susceptible to NAFLD; hepatic fat content was more than twofold higher in PNPLA3 rs738409[G] homozygotes than in noncarriers. Resequencing revealed another allele of PNPLA3 (rs6006460[T], encoding S453I) that was associated with lower hepatic fat content in African Americans, the group at lowest risk of NAFLD. Thus, variation in PNPLA3 contributes to ancestry-related and inter-individual differences in hepatic fat content and susceptibility to NAFLD.},

abstract = {Summary Although it is well documented that obesity is strongly associated with morbidity and mortality, less is known about the impact of obesity on functional status and health-related quality of life (HRQL). However, in recent years research has been conducted to estimate the impact of obesity on HRQL, and to determine the effects of weight reduction on HRQL. The majority of published studies indicate that obesity impairs HRQL, and that higher degrees of obesity are associated with greater impairment. Obesity-associated decrements on HRQL tend to be most pronounced on physical domains of functioning. Studies of the effect of obesity surgery among morbidly obese patients indicate that this procedure produces significant and sustained improvements in the majority of HRQL indices; among mild-to-moderately obese persons, modest weight reduction derived from lifestyle modification also appears to improve HRQL, at least in the short term. Additional research is needed to (1) further characterize the effect that obesity has on HRQL; (2) estimate the short- and long-term effects of various methods of weight reduction (e.g. surgery, lifestyle modification) on HRQL; (3) improve both the conceptualization and measurement of HRQL to incorporate the personal preferences and values of the patient; and (4) develop ways to enhance and sustain positive changes in HRQL, even if weight maintenance is elusive.},

abstract = {Most obese individuals have elevated plasma levels of free fatty acids (FFA) which  are known to cause peripheral (muscle) insulin resistance. They do this by inhibiting insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis. The mechanism involves intramyocellular accumulation of diacylglycerol and activation of protein kinase C. FFAs also cause hepatic insulin resistance. They do this by inhibiting insulin-mediated suppression of glycogenolysis. On the other hand, FFAs support between 30 and 50 {\%} of basal insulin secretion and potentiate glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. The insulin stimulatory action of FFAs is responsible for the fact that the vast majority ( approximately 80 {\%}) of obese insulin resistant people do not develop type 2 diabetes. They are able to compensate for their FFA mediated insulin resistance with increased FFA mediated insulin secretion. Individuals who are unable to do this (probably for genetic reasons) eventually develop type 2 diabetes. FFAs have recently been shown to activate the IkappaB/NFkappaB pathway which is involved in many inflammatory processes. Thus, elevated plasma levels of FFAs are not only a major cause of insulin resistance in skeletal muscle and liver but may, in addition, play a role in the pathogenesis of coronary artery disease.},

Metabolomics in cancer research is most often used for case-control comparisons. Secondary applications include translational areas, such as patient prognosis, therapy control and tumor classification, or grading. Metabolomics is at a developmental stage with respect to epidemiology, with the majority of studies including less than 100 patients. Standardization is required especially concerning sample preparation and data analysis. In the second part of this review, we reconstructed a metabolic network of patients with cancer by quantitatively extracting all reports of altered metabolites: Alterations in energy metabolism, membrane, and fatty acid synthesis emerged, with tryptophan levels changed most frequently in various cancers. Metabolomics has the potential to evolve into a standard tool for future applications in epidemiology and translational cancer research, but further, large-scale studies including prospective validation are needed.},

abstract = {The body possesses an energy homeostasis system by which it adjusts food intake to match calories burned to keep body weight stableThe hormone leptin, which is made by adipose tissue in approximate proportion to fat stores, plays an important role in the control of energy homeostasis. When fat stores are expended, leptin falls, causing an increase in appetite and diminishing energy expenditure to return fat stores to their previous levelsBecause obesity results from the accretion of adipose tissue fat stores, leptin levels are high in obesity. The failure of this high leptin (and therapy with exogenous leptin) in the obese state to decrease feeding and return adipose mass to normal has suggested the existence of leptin resistance, in which obesity impairs leptin actionObesity provokes a number of changes to hypothalamic anatomy and physiology, many of which have been invoked as potential mediators of leptin resistance. These include the leptin-induced expression of leptin signalling inhibitors, hypothalamic inflammatory signalling and gliosis and endoplasmic reticulum stressA variety of data suggest that early steps in leptin signalling are appropriately enhanced in response to the high leptin levels in obesity and that elevated leptin itself may attenuate downstream leptin action. Hence, the failure of leptin to decrease food intake and body weight in obesity may result from high leptin levels producing changes that act downstream of the initial steps in leptin signalling to create a functional ceiling for leptin actionThe available data suggest that leptin functions primarily in defence against decreased body weight rather than in limiting increases in body weight},

abstract = {Across scientific disciplines, there is a rapidly growing recognition of the need for more statistically robust, transparent approaches to data visualization. Complementary to this, many scientists have called for plotting tools that accurately and transparently convey key aspects of statistical effects and raw data with minimal distortion. Previously common approaches, such as plotting conditional mean or median barplots together with error-bars have been criticized for distorting effect size, hiding underlying patterns in the raw data, and obscuring the assumptions upon which the most commonly used statistical tests are based. Here we describe a data visualization approach which overcomes these issues, providing maximal statistical information while preserving the desired 'inference at a glance' nature of barplots and other similar visualization devices. These "raincloud plots" can visualize raw data, probability density, and key summary statistics such as median, mean, and relevant confidence intervals in an appealing and flexible format with minimal redundancy. In this tutorial paper, we provide basic demonstrations of the strength of raincloud plots and similar approaches, outline potential modifications for their optimal use, and provide open-source code for their streamlined implementation in R, Python and Matlab ( https://github.com/RainCloudPlots/RainCloudPlots). Readers can investigate the R and Python tutorials interactively in the browser using Binder by Project Jupyter.},

abstract = {Although the link between excess body weight and cancer risk is now well-established (1), important questions surrounding this relationship remain unanswered. For example, the impact of the duration and degree of overweight and obesity across the life span and the identification of (site-specific) susceptibility windows are important issues we currently do not fully understand. In addition, an important yet unresolved question is how intentional weight loss might influence cancer risk. In their article published in this issue of JNCI Cancer Spectrum, Luo and colleagues (2) used data from a large cohort of US women to study the association between intentional weight loss during a 3-year window following baseline and subsequent cancer risk. After adjustments for baseline body mass index and other relevant covariates, the authors report statistically significant reductions in the risk of obesity-related cancer (especially endometrial cancer) in women who intentionally lost more than 5{\%} of their body weight, whereas unintentional weight loss or short-term weight gain showed no association. Because previous evidence on this topic has come from a small number of observational studies and from studies of patients undergoing bariatric surgery, this analysis based on prospective cohort data represents an important contribution to the field. Furthermore, it confers an important message for public health: among individuals who are overweight or obese, losing weight—even if reductions are small and regardless of age or the degree of excess weight—is beneficial for cancer risk.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Higher circulating levels of the branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs;  i.e., isoleucine, leucine, and valine) are strongly associated with higher type 2 diabetes risk, but it is not known whether this association is causal. We undertook large-scale human genetic analyses to address this question. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Genome-wide studies of BCAA levels in 16,596 individuals revealed five genomic regions associated at genome-wide levels of significance (p {\textless} 5 × 10-8). The strongest signal was 21 kb upstream of the PPM1K gene (beta in standard deviations [SDs] of leucine per allele = 0.08, p = 3.9 × 10-25), encoding an activator of the mitochondrial branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKD) responsible for the rate-limiting step in BCAA catabolism. In another analysis, in up to 47,877 cases of type 2 diabetes and 267,694 controls, a genetically predicted difference of 1 SD in amino acid level was associated with an odds ratio for type 2 diabetes of 1.44 (95{\%} CI 1.26-1.65, p = 9.5 × 10-8) for isoleucine, 1.85 (95{\%} CI 1.41-2.42, p = 7.3 × 10-6) for leucine, and 1.54 (95{\%} CI 1.28-1.84, p = 4.2 × 10-6) for valine. Estimates were highly consistent with those from prospective observational studies of the association between BCAA levels and incident type 2 diabetes in a meta-analysis of 1,992 cases and 4,319 non-cases. Metabolome-wide association analyses of BCAA-raising alleles revealed high specificity to the BCAA pathway and an accumulation of metabolites upstream of branched-chain alpha-ketoacid oxidation, consistent with reduced BCKD activity. Limitations of this study are that, while the association of genetic variants appeared highly specific, the possibility of pleiotropic associations cannot be entirely excluded. Similar to other complex phenotypes, genetic scores used in the study captured a limited proportion of the heritability in BCAA levels. Therefore, it is possible that only some of the mechanisms that increase BCAA levels or affect BCAA metabolism are implicated in type 2 diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence from this large-scale human genetic and metabolomic study is consistent with a causal role of BCAA metabolism in the aetiology of type 2 diabetes.},

abstract = {Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM) is a genetic-based cardiac disease accompanied by severe ventricular arrhythmias and a progressive substitution of the myocardium with fibro-fatty tissue. ACM is often associated with sudden cardiac death. Due to the reduced penetrance and variable expressivity, the presence of a genetic defect is not conclusive, thus complicating the diagnosis of ACM. Recent studies on human induced pluripotent stem cells-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) obtained from ACM individuals showed a dysregulated metabolic status, leading to the hypothesis that ACM pathology is characterized by an impairment in the energy metabolism. However, despite efforts having been made for the identification of ACM specific biomarkers, there is still a substantial lack of information regarding the whole metabolomic profile of ACM patients. The aim of the present study was to investigate the metabolic profiles of ACM patients compared to healthy controls (CTRLs). The targeted Biocrates AbsoluteIDQ{\textregistered} p180 assay was used on plasma samples. Our analysis showed that ACM patients have a different metabolome compared to CTRLs, and that the pathways mainly affected include tryptophan metabolism, arginine and proline metabolism and beta oxidation of fatty acids. Altogether, our data indicated that the plasma metabolomes of arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy patients show signs of endothelium damage and impaired nitric oxide (NO), fat, and energy metabolism.},

Their functions include "primary" functions in metabolism and energy storage, as well as "secondary" functions in cell-to-cell signaling, metal acquisition, and virulence. There remains much to be learned about the in vivo roles of metabolites. Approaches that accelerate measurement of metabolite levels directly from cells and tissues should increase our understanding of the diverse roles of metabolites and potentially lead to discovery of novel metabolites and metabolic pathways. Metabolomics is an important comparative tool to study global metabolite levels in samples under various conditions. In this unit, the steps needed to perform a mass spectrometry (MS)--based untargeted metabolomics experiment using bacterial supernatants are detailed. In contrast to a targeted metabolomics experiment, which measures ions from known metabolites, an untargeted metabolomics experiment registers all ions within a certain mass range, including ions belonging to structurally novel metabolites. The protocols in this unit describe the conditions necessary for analyzing hydrophobic metabolites and provide an example of how to structurally characterize a novel metabolite.},

Mediation analysis experiences a number of methodological difficulties, including bias due to confounding and measurement error. Mendelian randomisation (MR) can be used to improve causal inference for mediation analysis. We describe two approaches that can be used for estimating mediation analysis with MR: multivariable Mendelian randomisation (MVMR) and two-step Mendelian randomisation. We outline the approaches and provide code to demonstrate how they can be used in mediation analysis. We review issues that can affect analyses, including confounding, measurement error, weak instrument bias, and analysis of multiple mediators. Description of the methods is supplemented by simulated and real data examples. Although Mendelian randomisation relies on large sample sizes and strong assumptions, such as having strong instruments and no horizontally pleiotropic pathways, our examples demonstrate that it is unlikely to be affected by confounders of the exposure or mediator and the outcome, reverse causality and non-differential measurement error of the exposure or mediator. Both MVMR and two-step MR can be implemented in both individual-level MR and summary data MR, and can improve causal inference in mediation analysis.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

abstract = {Adipose tissue plays important roles in regulating carbohydrate and lipid  homeostasis, but less is known about the regulation of amino acid metabolism in adipocytes. Here we applied isotope tracing to pre-adipocytes and differentiated adipocytes to quantify the contributions of different substrates to tricarboxylic acid (TCA) metabolism and lipogenesis. In contrast to proliferating cells, which use glucose and glutamine for acetyl-coenzyme A (AcCoA) generation, differentiated adipocytes showed increased branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) catabolic flux such that leucine and isoleucine from medium and/or from protein catabolism accounted for as much as 30{\%} of lipogenic AcCoA pools. Medium cobalamin deficiency caused methylmalonic acid accumulation and odd-chain fatty acid synthesis. Vitamin B12 supplementation reduced these metabolites and altered the balance of substrates entering mitochondria. Finally, inhibition of BCAA catabolism compromised adipogenesis. These results quantitatively highlight the contribution of BCAAs to adipocyte metabolism and suggest that BCAA catabolism has a functional role in adipocyte differentiation.},

Elevated very low-density lipoproteins, triglycerides, apolipoprotein-B/A, and monounsaturated fatty acids ratio were associated with lower odds of anorexia nervosa at age 18, while elevated high-density lipoproteins, docosahexaenoic acid and polyunsaturated fatty acids ratio, and fatty acid unsaturation were associated with higher risk for anorexia nervosa at 18 years. Elevated linoleic acid and n-6 fatty acid ratios were associated with lower odds of binge-eating disorder at 16 years, while elevated saturated fatty acid ratio was associated with higher odds of binge-eating disorder. Most associations had large confidence intervals and showed, for anorexia nervosa, different directions across time points. Overall, our results show some evidence for a role of metabolic factors in eating disorders development in adolescence.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: While dietary fat has been established as a risk factor for colorectal cancer (CRC), associations between fatty acids (FAs) and CRC have been inconsistent. Using Mendelian randomisation (MR), we sought to evaluate associations between polyunsaturated (PUFA), monounsaturated (MUFA) and saturated FAs (SFAs) and CRC risk. METHODS: We analysed genotype data on 9254 CRC cases and 18,386 controls of European ancestry. Externally weighted polygenic risk scores were generated and used to evaluate associations with CRC per one standard deviation increase in genetically defined plasma FA levels. RESULTS: Risk reduction was observed for oleic and palmitoleic MUFAs (OR(OA) = 0.77, 95{\%} CI: 0.65-0.92, P = 3.9 × 10(-3); OR(POA) = 0.36, 95{\%} CI: 0.15-0.84, P = 0.018). PUFAs linoleic and arachidonic acid had negative and positive associations with CRC respectively (OR(LA) = 0.95, 95{\%} CI: 0.93-0.98, P = 3.7 × 10(-4); OR(AA) = 1.05, 95{\%} CI: 1.02-1.07, P = 1.7 × 10(-4)). The SFA stearic acid was associated with increased CRC risk (OR(SA) = 1.17, 95{\%} CI: 1.01-1.35, P = 0.041). CONCLUSION: Results from our analysis are broadly consistent with a pro-inflammatory FA profile having a detrimental effect in terms of CRC risk.},

While there is some evidence of a reciprocal relationship between obesity and depression, there are limited data about the rates of depression among general practice patients who are underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obese.Aim To explore the prevalence of depression among underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obese general practice patients.Design and setting A cross-sectional survey was conducted in 12 Australian general practices.Method Patients aged ≥18 years and older who were presenting for general practice care were eligible to participate. Consenting patients completed a touchscreen computer survey assessing self-reported weight and height. Depression was assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), with a score of ≥10 used to indicate possible depression.Results Data were obtained from 3361 participants. The prevalence of depression was 24{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval [CI] = 11.86 to 39.28) among underweight participants, 11{\%} (95{\%} CI = 8.5 to 14.0) among normal weight participants, 12{\%} (95{\%} CI = 0.9 to 15.2) among overweight participants, and 23{\%} (95{\%} CI = 17.8 to 29.0) among obese participants. The prevalence of depression was higher for women than for men across all weight categories except underweight.Conclusion Weight and depression demonstrated a U-shaped relationship, with higher prevalence of depression observed among underweight and obese general practice patients. These conditions may act as red flags for opportunistic screening of depression in the general practice setting.},

abstract = {Mendelian randomization is the use of genetic variants as instrumental variables to estimate causal effects of risk factors on outcomes. The total causal effect of a risk factor is the change in the outcome resulting from intervening on the risk factor. This total causal effect may potentially encompass multiple mediating mechanisms. For a proposed mediator, the direct effect of the risk factor is the change in the outcome resulting from a change in the risk factor, keeping the mediator constant. A difference between the total effect and the direct effect indicates that the causal pathway from the risk factor to the outcome acts at least in part via the mediator (an indirect effect). Here, we show that Mendelian randomization estimates of total and direct effects can be obtained using summarized data on genetic associations with the risk factor, mediator, and outcome, potentially from different data sources. We perform simulations to test the validity of this approach when there is unmeasured confounding and/or bidirectional effects between the risk factor and mediator. We illustrate this method using the relationship between age at menarche and risk of breast cancer, with body mass index (BMI) as a potential mediator. We show an inverse direct causal effect of age at menarche on risk of breast cancer (independent of BMI), and a positive indirect effect via BMI. In conclusion, multivariable Mendelian randomization using summarized genetic data provides a rapid and accessible analytic strategy that can be undertaken using publicly available data to better understand causal mechanisms.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Depression has been associated with metabolic alterations, which  adversely impact cardiometabolic health. Here, a comprehensive set of metabolic markers, predominantly lipids, was compared between depressed and nondepressed persons. METHODS: Nine Dutch cohorts were included, comprising 10,145 control subjects and 5283 persons with depression, established with diagnostic interviews or questionnaires. A proton nuclear magnetic resonance metabolomics platform provided 230 metabolite measures: 51 lipids, fatty acids, and low-molecular-weight metabolites; 98 lipid composition and particle concentration measures of lipoprotein subclasses; and 81 lipid and fatty acids ratios. For each metabolite measure, logistic regression analyses adjusted for gender, age, smoking, fasting status, and lipid-modifying medication were performed within cohort, followed by random-effects meta-analyses. RESULTS: Of the 51 lipids, fatty acids, and low-molecular-weight metabolites, 21 were significantly related to depression (false discovery rate q {\textless} .05). Higher levels of apolipoprotein B, very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, diglycerides, total and monounsaturated fatty acids, fatty acid chain length, glycoprotein acetyls, tyrosine, and isoleucine and lower levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, acetate, and apolipoprotein A1 were associated with increased odds of depression. Analyses of lipid composition indicators confirmed a shift toward less high-density lipoprotein and more very-low-density lipoprotein and triglyceride particles in depression. Associations appeared generally consistent across gender, age, and body mass index strata and across cohorts with depressive diagnoses versus symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: This large-scale meta-analysis indicates a clear distinctive profile of circulating lipid metabolites associated with depression, potentially opening new prevention or treatment avenues for depression and its associated cardiometabolic comorbidity.},

abstract = {Adipose tissue is now recognised as a highly active metabolic and endocrine organ. Great strides have been made in uncovering the multiple functions of the adipocyte in cellular and molecular detail, but it is essential to remember that adipose tissue normally operates as a structured whole. Its functions are regulated by multiple external influences such as autonomic nervous system activity, the rate of blood flow and the delivery of a complex mix of substrates and hormones in the plasma. Attempting to understand how all these factors converge and regulate adipose tissue function is a prime example of integrative physiology. Adipose tissue metabolism is extremely dynamic, and the supply of and removal of substrates in the blood is acutely regulated according to the nutritional state. Adipose tissue possesses the ability to a very large extent to modulate its own metabolic activities, including differentiation of new adipocytes and production of blood vessels as necessary to accommodate increasing fat stores. At the same time, adipocytes signal to other tissues to regulate their energy metabolism in accordance with the body's nutritional state. Ultimately adipocyte fat stores have to match the body's overall surplus or deficit of energy. This implies the existence of one (or more) signal(s) to the adipose tissue that reflects the body's energy status, and points once again to the need for an integrative view of adipose tissue function.},

Among pre- and postmenopausal women, 284 women developed endometrial cancer during follow-up. Using risk set sampling, 546 matched control subjects were selected. From conditional logistic regression models, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels were inversely associated with risk body mass index (BMI)-adjusted relative risk (RR) for top versus bottom quartile 0.61 (95{\%} confidence intervals (CI) 0.38-0.97), P(trend) = 0.02). Glucose levels were positively associated with risk (BMI-adjusted RR top versus bottom quartile 1.69 (95{\%} CI 0.99-2.90), P(trend) = 0.03), which appeared stronger among postmenopausal women (BMI-adjusted RR top versus bottom tertile 2.61 (95{\%} CI 1.46-4.66), P(trend) = 0.0006, P(heterogeneity) = 0.13) and never-users of exogenous hormones (P(heterogeneity) = 0.005 for oral contraceptive (OC) use and 0.05 for hormone replacement therapy-use). The associations of HDL-C and glucose with risk were no longer statistically significant after further adjustment for obesity-related hormones. Plasma total cholesterol, Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and triglycerides were not significantly related to overall risk. The presence of MetS was associated with risk (RR 2.12 (95{\%} CI 1.51-2.97)), which increased with the number of MetS factors (P(trend) = 0.02). An increasing number of MetS factors other than waist circumference, however, was marginally significantly associated with risk only in women with waist circumference above the median (P(interaction) = 0.01). None of the associations differed significantly by fasting status. These findings suggest that metabolic abnormalities and obesity may act synergistically to increase endometrial cancer risk.},

abstract = {Mendelian randomization investigations are becoming more powerful and simpler to perform, due to the increasing size and coverage of genome-wide association studies and the increasing availability of summarized data on genetic associations with risk factors and disease outcomes. However, when using multiple genetic variants from different gene regions in a Mendelian randomization analysis, it is highly implausible that all the genetic variants satisfy the instrumental variable assumptions. This means that a simple instrumental variable analysis alone should not be relied on to give a causal conclusion. In this article, we discuss a range of sensitivity analyses that will either support or question the validity of causal inference from a Mendelian randomization analysis with multiple genetic variants. We focus on sensitivity analyses of greatest practical relevance for ensuring robust causal inferences, and those that can be undertaken using summarized data. Aside from cases in which the justification of the instrumental variable assumptions is supported by strong biological understanding, a Mendelian randomization analysis in which no assessment of the robustness of the findings to violations of the instrumental variable assumptions has been made should be viewed as speculative and incomplete. In particular, Mendelian randomization investigations with large numbers of genetic variants without such sensitivity analyses should be treated with skepticism.},

Knowledge of genetic variation in metabolism has many applications of biomedical and pharmaceutical interests, including the functional understanding of genetic associations with clinical end points, design of strategies to correct dysregulations in metabolic disorders and the identification of genetic effect modifiers of metabolic disease biomarkers. Furthermore, it has been shown that GIMs provide testable hypotheses for functional genomics and metabolomics and for the identification of novel gene functions and metabolite identities. mGWAS with growing sample sizes and increasingly complex metabolic trait panels are being conducted, allowing for more comprehensive and systems-based downstream analyses. The generated large datasets of genetic associations can now be mined by the biomedical research community and provide valuable resources for hypothesis-driven studies. In this review, we provide a brief summary of the key aspects of mGWAS, followed by an update of recently published mGWAS. We then discuss new approaches of integrating and exploring mGWAS results and finish by presenting selected applications of GIMs in recent studies.},

Among these studies, only a few have used C-statistic, paired homogeneity test or log-likelihood ratio test for formally comparing the differences. Five prospective studies, in which formal statistic tests have been made, came out with inconsistent findings: two results were in favour of WC in Mexicans African Americanss, respectively, one result was in favour of BMI in Pima Indians, and no difference was found in the other 2 studies. Among the 11 cross-sectional studies that have formally tested the differences, most found a higher odds ratio or slightly larger area under the ROC curve (AUC) for WC than for BMI. A meta-analysis based on the individual data of the Asian cohorts using a paired homogeneity test showed, however, that there was no difference in odds ratio between BMI and WC in Chinese, Japanese, Indian, Mongolian and Filipino men. In conclusion, all studies included in this review showed that either BMI or WC (WHR) predicted or was associated with type II diabetes independently, regardless of the controversial findings on which of these obesity indicators is better.},

Incidence of total, ischemic, and hemorrhagic stroke was measured by self-report and confirmed by medical record review. We used Cox proportional hazards models to evaluate the association of body mass index (BMI), calculated as self-reported weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters, with risk of total, ischemic, and hemorrhagic stroke.During 12.5 years of follow-up, 747 strokes (631 ischemic, 104 hemorrhagic, and 12 undefined) occurred. Compared with participants with BMIs less than 23, those with BMIs of 30 or greater had an adjusted relative risk of 2.00 (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 1.48-2.71) for total stroke, 1.95 (95{\%} CI, 1.39-2.72) for ischemic stroke, and 2.25 (95{\%} CI, 1.01-5.01) for hemorrhagic stroke. When BMI was evaluated as a continuous variable, each unit increase of BMI was associated with a significant 6{\%} increase in the adjusted relative risks of total (95{\%} CI, 4{\%}-8{\%}), ischemic (95{\%} CI, 3{\%}-8{\%}), and hemorrhagic stroke (95{\%} CI, 1{\%}-12{\%}). Additional adjustment for hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hypercholesterolemia slightly attenuated the risks for total and ischemic (relative risk, 4{\%}; 95{\%} CI, 2{\%}-7{\%}), but not hemorrhagic, stroke.These prospective data indicate a significant increase in the relative risk of total stroke and its 2 major subtypes with each unit increase of BMI that is independent of the effects of hypertension, diabetes, and cholesterol. Because BMI is a modifiable risk factor, the prevention of stroke may be another benefit associated with preventing obesity in adults.Arch Intern Med. 2002;162:2557-2562--{\textgreater}},

A very common and simple version of the meta-analysis procedure is commonly referred to as the inverse-variance method. This approach is implemented in its most basic form in RevMan, and is used behind the scenes in many meta-analyses of both dichotomous and continuous data. Results may be expressed as count data when each participant may experience an event, and may experience it more than once. Count data may be analysed using methods for dichotomous data if the counts are dichotomized for each individual, continuous data and time-to-event data, as well as being analysed as rate data. Prediction intervals from random-effects meta-analyses are a useful device for presenting the extent of between-study variation. Sensitivity analyses should be used to examine whether overall findings are robust to potentially influential decisions.},

abstract = {The body possesses an energy homeostasis system by which it adjusts food intake to match calories burned to keep body weight stableThe hormone leptin, which is made by adipose tissue in approximate proportion to fat stores, plays an important role in the control of energy homeostasis. When fat stores are expended, leptin falls, causing an increase in appetite and diminishing energy expenditure to return fat stores to their previous levelsBecause obesity results from the accretion of adipose tissue fat stores, leptin levels are high in obesity. The failure of this high leptin (and therapy with exogenous leptin) in the obese state to decrease feeding and return adipose mass to normal has suggested the existence of leptin resistance, in which obesity impairs leptin actionObesity provokes a number of changes to hypothalamic anatomy and physiology, many of which have been invoked as potential mediators of leptin resistance. These include the leptin-induced expression of leptin signalling inhibitors, hypothalamic inflammatory signalling and gliosis and endoplasmic reticulum stressA variety of data suggest that early steps in leptin signalling are appropriately enhanced in response to the high leptin levels in obesity and that elevated leptin itself may attenuate downstream leptin action. Hence, the failure of leptin to decrease food intake and body weight in obesity may result from high leptin levels producing changes that act downstream of the initial steps in leptin signalling to create a functional ceiling for leptin actionThe available data suggest that leptin functions primarily in defence against decreased body weight rather than in limiting increases in body weight},

Here, using genome-wide association meta-analysis of 606,059 parents' survival, we discover two regions associated with longevity (HLA-DQA1/DRB1 and LPA). We also validate previous suggestions that APOE, CHRNA3/5, CDKN2A/B, SH2B3 and FOXO3A influence longevity. Next we show that giving up smoking, educational attainment, openness to new experience and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels are most positively genetically correlated with lifespan while susceptibility to coronary artery disease (CAD), cigarettes smoked per day, lung cancer, insulin resistance and body fat are most negatively correlated. We suggest that the effect of education on lifespan is principally mediated through smoking while the effect of obesity appears to act via CAD. Using instrumental variables, we suggest that an increase of one body mass index unit reduces lifespan by 7 months while 1 year of education adds 11 months to expected lifespan.Variability in human longevity is genetically influenced. Using genetic data of parental lifespan, the authors identify associations at HLA-DQA/DRB1 and LPA and find that genetic variants that increase educational attainment have a positive effect on lifespan whereas increasing BMI negatively affects lifespan.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Body mass index (BMI) during adulthood is inversely related to the  incidence of premenopausal breast cancer, but the role of body fatness earlier in life is less clear. We examined prospectively the relation between body fatness during childhood and adolescence and the incidence of breast cancer in premenopausal women. METHODS: Participants were 109,267 premenopausal women in the Nurses' Health Study II who recalled their body fatness at ages 5, 10 and 20 years using a validated 9-level figure drawing. Over 12 years of follow up, 1318 incident cases of breast cancer were identified. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to compute relative risks (RRs) and 95{\%} confidence intervals (CIs) for body fatness at each age and for average childhood (ages 5-10 years) and adolescent (ages 10-20 years) fatness. RESULTS: Body fatness at each age was inversely associated with premenopausal breast cancer incidence; the multivariate RRs were 0.48 (95{\%} CI 0.35-0.55) and 0.57 (95{\%} CI 0.39-0.83) for the most overweight compared with the most lean in childhood and adolescence, respectively (P for trend {\textless} 0.0001). The association for childhood body fatness was only slightly attenuated after adjustment for later BMI, with a multivariate RR of 0.52 (95{\%} CI 0.38-0.71) for the most overweight compared with the most lean (P for trend = 0.001). Adjustment for menstrual cycle characteristics had little impact on the association. CONCLUSION: Greater body fatness during childhood and adolescence is associated with reduced incidence of premenopausal breast cancer, independent of adult BMI and menstrual cycle characteristics.},

abstract = {Mendelian randomization analyses are often performed using summarized data. The causal estimate from a one-sample analysis (in which data are taken from a single data source) with weak instrumental variables is biased in the direction of the observational association between the risk factor and outcome, whereas the estimate from a two-sample analysis (in which data on the risk factor and outcome are taken from non-overlapping datasets) is less biased and any bias is in the direction of the null. When using genetic consortia that have partially overlapping sets of participants, the direction and extent of bias are uncertain. In this paper, we perform simulation studies to investigate the magnitude of bias and Type 1 error rate inflation arising from sample overlap. We consider both a continuous outcome and a case-control setting with a binary outcome. For a continuous outcome, bias due to sample overlap is a linear function of the proportion of overlap between the samples. So, in the case of a null causal effect, if the relative bias of the one-sample instrumental variable estimate is 10{\%} (corresponding to an F parameter of 10), then the relative bias with 50{\%} sample overlap is 5{\%}, and with 30{\%} sample overlap is 3{\%}. In a case-control setting, if risk factor measurements are only included for the control participants, unbiased estimates are obtained even in a one-sample setting. However, if risk factor data on both control and case participants are used, then bias is similar with a binary outcome as with a continuous outcome. Consortia releasing publicly available data on the associations of genetic variants with continuous risk factors should provide estimates that exclude case participants from case-control samples.},

Here we show that one standard deviation higher genetically determined height ({\~{}}6.5 cm) is causally associated with a 16{\%} decrease in CAD risk (OR = 0.84, 95{\%} CI 0.80–0.87). This causal association remains after performing sensitivity analyses relaxing pleiotropy assumptions. The causal effect of height on CAD risk is reduced by 1–3{\%} after adjustment for potential mediators (lipids, blood pressure, glycaemic traits, body mass index, socio-economic status). In contrast, our data suggest that lung function (measured by forced expiratory volume [FEV1] and forced vital capacity [FVC]) is a mediator of the effect of height on CAD. We observe no direct causal effect of height on the risk of T2D.},

There is a need for a more precise yet portable method of phenotyping and categorizing risk in large numbers of people with obesity to advance clinical care and drug development. Here, we used non-targeted metabolomics and whole-genome sequencing to identify metabolic and genetic signatures of obesity. We find that obesity results in profound perturbation of the metabolome; nearly a third of the assayed metabolites associated with changes in BMI. A metabolome signature identifies the healthy obese and lean individuals with abnormal metabolomes-these groups differ in health outcomes and underlying genetic risk. Specifically, an abnormal metabolome associated with a 2- to 5-fold increase in cardiovascular events when comparing individuals who were matched for BMI but had opposing metabolome signatures. Because metabolome profiling identifies clinically meaningful heterogeneity in obesity, this approach could help select patients for clinical trials.},

abstract = {AIMS: To appraise the clinical and genetic evidence that low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) cause atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). METHODS AND RESULTS: We assessed whether the association between LDL and ASCVD fulfils the criteria for causality by evaluating the totality of evidence from genetic studies, prospective epidemiologic cohort studies, Mendelian randomization studies, and randomized trials of LDL-lowering therapies. In clinical studies, plasma LDL burden is usually estimated by determination of plasma LDL cholesterol level (LDL-C). Rare genetic mutations that cause reduced LDL receptor function lead to markedly higher LDL-C and a dose-dependent increase in the risk of ASCVD, whereas rare variants leading to lower LDL-C are associated with a correspondingly lower risk of ASCVD. Separate meta-analyses of over 200 prospective cohort studies, Mendelian randomization studies, and randomized trials including more than 2 million participants with over 20 million person-years of follow-up and over 150 000 cardiovascular events demonstrate a remarkably consistent dose-dependent log-linear association between the absolute magnitude of exposure of the vasculature to LDL-C and the risk of ASCVD; and this effect appears to increase with increasing duration of exposure to LDL-C. Both the naturally randomized genetic studies and the randomized intervention trials consistently demonstrate that any mechanism of lowering plasma LDL particle concentration should reduce the risk of ASCVD events proportional to the absolute reduction in LDL-C and the cumulative duration of exposure to lower LDL-C, provided that the achieved reduction in LDL-C is concordant with the reduction in LDL particle number and that there are no competing deleterious off-target effects. CONCLUSION: Consistent evidence from numerous and multiple different types of clinical and genetic studies unequivocally establishes that LDL causes ASCVD.},

abstract = {RATIONALE: Obesity increases the risk and severity of sleep-disordered breathing. The degree to which excess body weight contributes to blood oxygen desaturation during hypopneic and apneic events has not been comprehensively characterized. OBJECTIVES: To quantify the association between excess body weight and oxygen desaturation during sleep-disordered breathing. METHODS: A total of 750 adult participants in the Wisconsin Sleep Cohort Study were assessed for body mass index (BMI) (kg/m(2)) and sleep-disordered breathing. The amount of Sa(O(2)), duration, and other characteristics of 37,473 observed breathing events were measured during polysomnography studies. A mixed-effects linear regression model estimated the association of blood oxygen desaturation with participant-level characteristics, including BMI, gender, and age, and event-level characteristics, including baseline Sa(O(2)), change in Vt, event duration, sleep state, and body position. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: BMI was positively associated with oxygen desaturation severity independent of age, gender, sleeping position, baseline Sa(O(2)), and event duration. BMI interacted with sleep state such that BMI predicted greater desaturation in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep than in non-REM sleep. Each increment of 10 kg/m(2) BMI predicted a 1.0{\%} (SE, 0.2{\%}) greater mean blood oxygen desaturation for persons in REM sleep experiencing hypopnea events associated with 80{\%} Vt reductions. CONCLUSIONS: Excess body weight is an important predictor of the severity of blood oxygen desaturation during apnea and hypopnea events, potentially exacerbating the impact of sleep-disordered breathing in obese patients.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: While several lines of evidence prove that elevated concentrations of  low-density lipoproteins (LDL) causally contribute to the development of atherosclerosis and its clinical consequences, high-density lipoproteins are still widely believed to exert atheroprotective effects. Hence, HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) is in general still considered as "good cholesterol". Recent research, however, suggests that this might not always be the case and that a fundamental reassessment of the clinical significance of HDL-C is warranted. METHOD: This review article is based on a selective literature review. RESULTS: In individuals without a history of cardiovascular events, low concentrations of HDL-C are inversely associated with the risk of future cardiovascular events. This relationship may, however, not apply to patients with metabolic disorders or manifest cardiovascular disease. The classical function of HDL is to mobilise cholesterol from extrahepatic tissues for delivery to the liver for excretion. These roles in cholesterol metabolism as well as many other biological functions of HDL particles are dependent on the number as well as protein and lipid composition of HDL particles. They are poorly reflected by the HDL-C concentration. HDL can even exert negative vascular effects, if its composition is pathologically altered. High serum HDL-C is therefore no longer regarded protective. In line with this, recent pharmacological approaches to raise HDL-C concentration have not been able to show reductions of cardiovascular outcomes. CONCLUSION: In contrast to LDL cholesterol (LDL-C), HDL-C correlates with cardiovascular risk only in healthy individuals. The calculation of the ratio of LDL-C to HDL-C is not useful for all patients. Low HDL-C should prompt examination of additional metabolic and inflammatory pathologies. An increase in HDL-C through lifestyle change (smoking cessation, physical exercise) has positive effects and is recommended. However, HDL-C is currently not a valid target for drug therapy.},

abstract = {AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: The extent to which effects of BMI on CHD are mediated by glycaemic and lipid risk factors is unclear. In this study we examined the effects of these traits using genetic evidence. METHODS: We used two-sample Mendelian randomisation to determine: (1) the causal effect of BMI on CHD (60,801 case vs 123,504 control participants), type 2 diabetes (34,840 case vs 114,981 control participants), fasting glucose (n = 46,186), insulin (n = 38,238), HbA(1c) (n = 46,368) and LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and triacylglycerols (n = 188,577); (2) the causal effects of glycaemic and lipids traits on CHD; and (3) the extent to which these traits mediate any effect of BMI on CHD. RESULTS: One SD higher BMI ({\~{}} 4.5 kg/m(2)) was associated with higher risk of CHD (OR 1.45 [95{\%} CI 1.27, 1.66]) and type 2 diabetes (1.96 [95{\%} CI 1.35, 2.83]), higher levels of fasting glucose (0.07 mmol/l [95{\%} CI 0.03, 0.11]), HbA(1c) (0.05{\%} [95{\%} CI 0.01, 0.08]), fasting insulin (0.18 log pmol/l [95{\%} CI 0.14, 0.22]) and triacylglycerols (0.20 SD [95{\%} CI 0.14, 0.26]) and lower levels of HDL-cholesterol (-0.23 SD [95{\%} CI -0.32, -0.15]). There was no evidence for a causal relation between BMI and LDL-cholesterol. The causal associations of higher triacylglycerols, HbA(1c) and diabetes risk with CHD risk remained after performing sensitivity analyses that considered different models of horizontal pleiotropy. The BMI-CHD effect reduced from 1.45 to 1.16 (95{\%} CI 0.99, 1.36) and to 1.36 (95{\%} CI 1.19, 1.57) with genetic adjustment for triacylglycerols or HbA(1c), respectively, and to 1.09 (95{\%} CI 0.94, 1.27) with adjustment for both. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Increased triacylglycerol levels and poor glycaemic control appear to mediate much of the effect of BMI on CHD.},

To better understand the mechanisms regulating placental development and gene expression, we characterized the transcriptome of term placenta from 20 healthy women with uncomplicated pregnancies using RNA-seq. To identify genes that were highly expressed and unique to the placenta we compared placental RNA-seq data to data from 7 other tissues (adipose, breast, hear, kidney, liver, lung, and smooth muscle) and identified several genes novel to placental biology (QSOX1, DLG5, and SEMA7A). Semi-quantitative RT-PCR confirmed the RNA-seq results and immunohistochemistry indicated these proteins were highly expressed in the placental syncytium. Additionally, we mined our RNA-seq data to map the relative expression of key developmental gene families (Fox, Sox, Gata, Tead, and Wnt) within the placenta. We identified FOXO4, GATA3, and WNT7A to be amongst the highest expressed members of these families. Overall, these findings provide a new reference for understanding of placental transcriptome and can aid in the identification of novel pathways regulating placenta physiology that may be dysregulated in placental disease.},

METHODS AND RESULTS: We analysed 6171 subjects {\textgreater}20 years of age from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) and the NHANES III mortality study, whose BMI was within the normal range (18.5-24.9 kg/m(2)), and who underwent a complete evaluation that included body composition assessment, blood measurements, and assessment of CV risk factors. Survival information was available for {\textgreater}99{\%} of the subjects after a median follow-up of 8.8 years. We divided our sample using sex-specific tertiles of BF{\%}. The highest tertile of BF ({\textgreater}23.1{\%} in men and {\textgreater}33.3{\%} in women) was labelled as NWO. When compared with the low BF group, the prevalence of metabolic syndrome in subjects with NWO was four-fold higher (16.6 vs. 4.8{\%}, P {\textless} 0.0001). Subjects with NWO also had higher prevalence of dyslipidaemia, hypertension (men), and CV disease (women). After adjustment, women with NWO showed a significant 2.2-fold increased risk for CV mortality (HR = 2.2; 95{\%} CI, 1.03-4.67) in comparison to the low BF group. CONCLUSION: Normal weight obesity, defined as the combination of normal BMI and high BF content, is associated with a high prevalence of cardiometabolic dysregulation, metabolic syndrome, and CV risk factors. In women, NWO is independently associated with increased risk for CV mortality.},

abstract = {Abstract Obesity is associated with increased risk for cardiovascular health problems including diabetes, hypertension, and stroke. These cardiovascular afflictions increase risk for cognitive decline and dementia, but it is unknown whether these factors, specifically obesity and Type II diabetes, are associated with specific patterns of brain atrophy. We used tensor-based morphometry (TBM) to examine gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) volume differences in 94 elderly subjects who remained cognitively normal for at least 5 years after their scan. Bivariate analyses with corrections for multiple comparisons strongly linked body mass index (BMI), fasting plasma insulin (FPI) levels, and Type II Diabetes Mellitus (DM2) with atrophy in frontal, temporal, and subcortical brain regions. A multiple regression model, also correcting for multiple comparisons, revealed that BMI was still negatively correlated with brain atrophy (FDR {\textless}5{\%}), while DM2 and FPI were no longer associated with any volume differences. In an Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) model controlling for age, gender, and race, obese subjects with a high BMI (BMI {\textgreater} 30) showed atrophy in the frontal lobes, anterior cingulate gyrus, hippocampus, and thalamus compared with individuals with a normal BMI (18.5?25). Overweight subjects (BMI: 25?30) had atrophy in the basal ganglia and corona radiata of the WM. Overall brain volume did not differ between overweight and obese persons. Higher BMI was associated with lower brain volumes in overweight and obese elderly subjects. Obesity is therefore associated with detectable brain volume deficits in cognitively normal elderly subjects. Hum Brain Mapp, 2010. ? 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

The Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) reporting guideline was followed.Obesity associated with type 2 diabetes, coronary artery disease, or stroke. The hypothesis was formulated prior to data collection.Of 4660 potentially relevant articles, 2511 titles were screened. Seven studies were included in the systematic review, and 5 studies with 881 692 participants were eligible to be included in the meta-analysis. Pooled estimates revealed that obesity was significantly associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes (OR, 1.67; 95{\%} CI, 1.30-2.14; P {\textless} .001; I2 = 93{\%}) and coronary artery disease (OR, 1.20; 95{\%} CI, 1.02-1.41; P = .03; I2 = 87{\%}). No association between obesity and stroke was found (OR, 1.02; 95{\%} CI, 0.95-1.09; P = .65; I2 = 0{\%}).The present meta-analysis suggests that obesity is associated with type 2 diabetes and coronary artery disease. Although this analysis of mendelian randomization studies does not prove causality, it is supportive of a causal association. Hence, health care practitioners should continue to emphasize weight reduction to combat coronary artery disease.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Breast cancer etiology in women may relate to exposures early in life as  well as in adulthood, but it has been difficult to gain information on childhood variables, and evidence on their effects is very limited. Comparison of risk factor levels between affected probands and unaffected twins in twin pairs can provide a unique method to investigate risk factors that act in early life. METHODS: We conducted four population-based case-control studies of breast cancer risk in twins in Denmark, England and Wales, Finland, and Sweden and pooled the data from these studies. The case patients were 400 women with incident breast cancer before the age of 50 years, and the control subjects were their twin sisters who had not had breast cancer by that time. Data on risk factors (e.g., demographic and anthropomorphic variables, reproductive history, and family history) were collected by interview and by a mailed questionnaire and were analyzed by calculating matched odds ratios [ORs]. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: The risk of breast cancer was increased for women who were less obese (OR = 1.44, 95{\%} confidence interval [CI] = 1.08 to 1.91) or taller (OR = 1.27, 95{\%} CI = 0.95 to 1.70) than their co-twin at age 10 years, for women who developed breasts earlier than their co-twin (OR = 1.53, 95{\%} CI = 1.14 to 2.06), and for women who had a smaller waist-to-hip ratio at age 20 years than their co-twin (OR = 1.79, 95{\%} CI = 1.00 to 3.21). Analysis according to family history of breast cancer showed that the associations of childhood height and weight with risk of breast cancer were only apparent in women without a family history of breast cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Childhood growth before puberty may affect the risk of premenopausal breast cancer, at least in women without a family history of breast cancer. The distribution of body fat in young adulthood may also be related to breast cancer risk.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although obesity and cardiometabolic traits commonly overlap, underlying pathways remain incompletely defined. The association of metabolite profiles across multiple cardiometabolic traits may lend insights into the interaction of obesity and metabolic health. We sought to investigate metabolic signatures of obesity and related cardiometabolic traits in the community using broad-based metabolomic profiling. METHODS AND RESULTS: We evaluated the association of 217 assayed metabolites and cross-sectional as well as longitudinal changes in cardiometabolic traits among 2,383 Framingham Offspring cohort participants. Body mass index (BMI) was associated with 69 of 217 metabolites (P{\textless}0.00023 for all), including aromatic (tyrosine, phenylalanine) and branched chain amino acids (valine, isoleucine, leucine). Additional metabolic pathways associated with BMI included the citric acid cycle (isocitrate, alpha-ketoglutarate, aconitate), the tryptophan pathway (kynurenine, kynurenic acid), and the urea cycle. There was considerable overlap in metabolite profiles between BMI, abdominal adiposity, insulin resistance [IR] and dyslipidemia, modest overlap of metabolite profiles between BMI and hyperglycemia, and little overlap with fasting glucose or elevated blood pressure. Metabolite profiles were associated with longitudinal changes in fasting glucose, but the involved metabolites (ornithine, 5-HIAA, aminoadipic acid, isoleucine, cotinine) were distinct from those associated with baseline glucose or other traits. Obesity status appeared to "modify" the association of 9 metabolites with IR. For example, bile acid metabolites were strongly associated with IR among obese but not lean individuals, whereas isoleucine had a stronger association with IR in lean individuals. CONCLUSIONS: In this large-scale metabolite profiling study, body mass index was associated with a broad range of metabolic alterations. Metabolite profiling highlighted considerable overlap with abdominal adiposity, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia, but not with fasting glucose or blood pressure traits.},

Here, we reanalyze the evidence used by CHESS, and find that nearly all protein-coding predictions are false positives. We find that 86{\%} overlap transposons marked by RepeatMasker that are known to frequently result in false positive protein-coding predictions. More than half are homologous to only nine Alu-derived primate sequences corresponding to an erroneous and previously withdrawn Pfam protein domain. The entire set shows poor evolutionary conservation and PhyloCSF protein-coding evolutionary signatures indistinguishable from noncoding RNAs, indicating lack of protein-coding constraint. Only four predictions are supported by mass spectrometry evidence, and even those matches are inconclusive. Overall, the new protein-coding predictions are unsupported by any credible experimental or evolutionary evidence of function, result primarily from homology to genes incorrectly classified as protein-coding, and are unlikely to encode functional proteins.},

abstract = {Obesity is an epidemic disease that threatens to inundate health care resources by increasing the incidence of diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, and cancer. These effects of obesity result from two factors: the increased mass of adipose tissue and the increased secretion of pathogenetic products from enlarged fat cells. This concept of the pathogenesis of obesity as a disease allows an easy division of disadvantages of obesity into those produced by the mass of fat and those produced by the metabolic effects of fat cells. In the former category are the social disabilities resulting from the stigma associated with obesity, sleep apnea that results in part from increased parapharyngeal fat deposits, and osteoarthritis resulting from the wear and tear on joints from carrying an increased mass of fat. The second category includes the metabolic factors associated with distant effects of products released from enlarged fat cells. The insulin-resistant state that is so common in obesity probably reflects the effects of increased release of fatty acids from fat cells that are then stored in the liver or muscle. When the secretory capacity of the pancreas is overwhelmed by battling insulin resistance, diabetes develops. The strong association of increased fat, especially visceral fat, with diabetes makes this consequence particularly ominous for health care costs. The release of cytokines, particularly IL-6, from the fat cell may stimulate the proinflammatory state that characterizes obesity. The increased secretion of prothrombin activator inhibitor-1 from fat cells may play a role in the procoagulant state of obesity and, along with changes in endothelial function, may be responsible for the increased risk of cardiovascular disease and hypertension. For cancer, the production of estrogens by the enlarged stromal mass plays a role in the risk for breast cancer. Increased cytokine release may play a role in other forms of proliferative growth. The combined effect of these pathogenetic consequences of increased fat stores is an increased risk of shortened life expectancy.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: It is unclear whether asthma is overdiagnosed in developed countries, particularly among obese individuals, who may be more likely than nonobese people to experience dyspnea. METHODS: We conducted a longitudinal study involving nonobese (body mass index 20-25) and obese (body mass index {\textgreater}/= 30) individuals with asthma that had been diagnosed by a physician. Participants were recruited from 8 Canadian cities by means of random-digit dialing. A diagnosis of current asthma was excluded in those who did not have evidence of acute worsening of asthma symptoms, reversible airflow obstruction or bronchial hyperresponsiveness, despite being weaned off asthma medications. We stopped asthma medications in those in whom a diagnosis of asthma was excluded and assessed their clinical outcomes over 6 months. RESULTS: Of 540 individuals with physician-diagnosed asthma who participated in the study, 496 (242 obese and 254 nonobese) could be conclusively assessed for a diagnosis of asthma. Asthma was ultimately excluded in 31.8{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval [CI] 26.3{\%}-37.9{\%}) in the obese group and in 28.7{\%} (95{\%} CI 23.5{\%}-34.6{\%}) in the nonobese group. Overdiagnosis of asthma was no more likely to occur among obese individuals than among nonobese individuals (p = 0.46). Of those in whom asthma was excluded, 65.5{\%} did not need to take asthma medication or seek health care services because of asthma symptoms during a 6-month follow-up period. INTERPRETATION: About one-third of obese and nonobese individuals with physician-diagnosed asthma did not have asthma when objectively assessed. This finding suggests that, in developed countries such as Canada, asthma is overdiagnosed.},

This review aims to evaluate the impact of Mendelian randomization studies on translational medicine for neurodegenerative diseases, highlighting the advances made and challenges faced. We will first describe the fundamental principles and limitations of Mendelian randomization and then discuss the lessons from Mendelian randomization studies of environmental risk factors for neurodegeneration.

abstract = {Obesity has been posited as an independent risk factor for diabetic kidney disease  (DKD), but establishing causality from observational data is problematic. We aimed to test whether obesity is causally related to DKD using Mendelian randomization, which exploits the random assortment of genes during meiosis. In 6,049 subjects with type 1 diabetes, we used a weighted genetic risk score (GRS) comprised of 32 validated BMI loci as an instrument to test the relationship of BMI with macroalbuminuria, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), or DKD defined as presence of macroalbuminuria or ESRD. We compared these results with cross-sectional and longitudinal observational associations. Longitudinal analysis demonstrated a U-shaped relationship of BMI with development of macroalbuminuria, ESRD, or DKD over time. Cross-sectional observational analysis showed no association with overall DKD, higher odds of macroalbuminuria (for every 1 kg/m(2) higher BMI, odds ratio [OR] 1.05, 95{\%} CI 1.03-1.07, P {\textless} 0.001), and lower odds of ESRD (OR 0.95, 95{\%} CI 0.93-0.97, P {\textless} 0.001). Mendelian randomization analysis showed a 1 kg/m(2) higher BMI conferring an increased risk in macroalbuminuria (OR 1.28, 95{\%} CI 1.11-1.45, P = 0.001), ESRD (OR 1.43, 95{\%} CI 1.20-1.72, P {\textless} 0.001), and DKD (OR 1.33, 95{\%} CI 1.17-1.51, P {\textless} 0.001). Our results provide genetic evidence for a causal link between obesity and DKD in type 1 diabetes. As obesity prevalence rises, this finding predicts an increase in DKD prevalence unless intervention should occur.},

abstract = {Summary Body mass index (BMI) is the cornerstone of the current classification system for obesity and its advantages are widely exploited across disciplines ranging from international surveillance to individual patient assessment. However, like all anthropometric measurements, it is only a surrogate measure of body fatness. Obesity is defined as an excess accumulation of body fat, and it is the amount of this excess fat that correlates with ill-health. We propose therefore that much greater attention should be paid to the development of databases and standards based on the direct measurement of body fat in populations, rather than on surrogate measures. In support of this argument we illustrate a wide range of conditions in which surrogate anthropometric measures (especially BMI) provide misleading information about body fat content. These include: infancy and childhood; ageing; racial differences; athletes; military and civil forces personnel; weight loss with and without exercise; physical training; and special clinical circumstances. We argue that BMI continues to serve well for many purposes, but that the time is now right to initiate a gradual evolution beyond BMI towards standards based on actual measurements of body fat mass.},

abstract = {RATIONALE: Although obesity has been implicated as an asthma risk factor, there is heterogeneity in the published literature regarding its role in asthma incidence, particularly in men. OBJECTIVES: To quantify the relationship between categories of body mass index (BMI) and incident asthma in adults and to evaluate the impact of sex on this relationship. METHODS: Online bibliographic databases were searched for prospective studies evaluating BMI and incident asthma in adults. Independent observers extracted data regarding annualized asthma incidence from studies meeting predetermined criteria, within defined categories of normal weight (BMI {\textless} 25), overweight (BMI, 25-29.9), and obesity (BMI {\textgreater}or= 30). Data were analyzed by inverse-variance-weighted, random-effects meta-analysis. Stratified analysis between BMI categories and within sex was performed. RESULTS: Seven studies (n=333,102 subjects) met inclusion criteria. Compared with normal weight, overweight and obesity (BMI {\textgreater}or= 25) conferred increased odds of incident asthma, with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.51 (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 1.27-1.80). A dose-response effect of elevated BMI on asthma incidence was observed; the OR for incident asthma for normal-weight versus overweight subjects was 1.38 (95{\%} CI, 1.17-1.62) and was further elevated for normal weight versus obesity (OR, 1.92; 95{\%} CI, 1.43-2.59; p{\textless}0.0001 for the trend). A similar increase in the OR of incident asthma due to overweight and obesity was observed in men (OR, 1.46; 95{\%} CI, 1.05-2.02) and women (OR, 1.68; 95{\%} CI, 1.45-1.94; p=0.232 for the comparison). CONCLUSIONS: Overweight and obesity are associated with a dose-dependent increase in the odds of incident asthma in men and women, suggesting asthma incidence could be reduced by interventions targeting overweight and obesity.},

abstract = {Obesity shares with most chronic diseases the presence of an inflammatory component, which accounts for the development of metabolic disease and other associated health alterations. This inflammatory state is reflected in increased circulating levels of pro-inflammatory proteins, and it occurs not only in adults but also in adolescents and children. The chronic inflammatory response has its origin in the links existing between the adipose tissue and the immune system. Obesity, like other states of malnutrition, is known to impair the immune function, altering leucocyte counts as well as cell-mediated immune responses. In addition, evidence has arisen that an altered immune function contributes to the pathogenesis of obesity. This review attempts to briefly comment on the various plausible explanations that have been proposed for the phenomenon: (1) the obesity-associated increase in the production of leptin (pro-inflammatory) and the reduction in adiponectin (anti-inflammatory) seem to affect the activation of immune cells; (2) NEFA can induce inflammation through various mechanisms (such as modulation of adipokine production or activation of Toll-like receptors); (3) nutrient excess and adipocyte expansion trigger endoplasmic reticulum stress; and (4) hypoxia occurring in hypertrophied adipose tissue stimulates the expression of inflammatory genes and activates immune cells. Interestingly, data suggest a greater impact of visceral adipose tissue and central obesity, rather than total body fat, on the inflammatory process. In summary, there is a positive feedback loop between local inflammation in adipose tissue and altered immune response in obesity, both contributing to the development of related metabolic complications. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Authors.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: A high body mass index (BMI) is a major risk factor for several chronic diseases, but the biology underlying these associations is not well-understood. Dyslipidemia, inflammation, and elevated levels of growth factors and sex steroid hormones explain some of the increased disease risk, but other metabolic factors not yet identified may also play a role. DESIGN: In order to discover novel metabolic biomarkers of BMI, we used non-targeted metabolomics to assay 317 metabolites in blood samples from 947 participants and examined the cross-sectional associations between metabolite levels and BMI. Participants were from three studies in the United States and China. Height, weight, and potential confounders were ascertained by questionnaire (US studies) or direct measurement (Chinese study). Metabolite levels were measured using liquid-phase chromatography and gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. We evaluated study-specific associations using linear regression, adjusted for age, gender, and smoking, and we estimated combined associations using random effects meta-analysis. RESULTS: The meta-analysis revealed 37 metabolites significantly associated with BMI, including 19 lipids, 12 amino acids, and 6 others, at the Bonferroni significance threshold (p{\textless}0.00016). Eighteen of these associations had not been previously reported, including histidine, an amino acid neurotransmitter, and butyrylcarnitine, a lipid marker of whole-body fatty acid oxidation. Heterogeneity by study was minimal (all P(heterogeneity) {\textgreater}0.05). In total, 110 metabolites were associated with BMI at the p{\textless}0.05 level. CONCLUSION: These findings establish a baseline for the BMI metabolome, and suggest new targets for researchers attempting to clarify mechanistic links between high BMIs and disease risk.},

abstract = {To infer the causal association between childhood BMI and age at menarche, we  performed a mendelian randomisation analysis using twelve established "BMI-increasing" genetic variants as an instrumental variable (IV) for higher BMI. In 8,156 women of European descent from the EPIC-Norfolk cohort, height was measured at age 39-77 years; age at menarche was self-recalled, as was body weight at age 20 years, and BMI at 20 was calculated as a proxy for childhood BMI. DNA was genotyped for twelve BMI-associated common variants (in/near FTO, MC4R, TMEM18, GNPDA2, KCTD15, NEGR1, BDNF, ETV5, MTCH2, SEC16B, FAIM2 and SH2B1), and for each individual a "BMI-increasing-allele-score" was calculated by summing the number of BMI-increasing alleles across all 12 loci. Using this BMI-increasing-allele-score as an instrumental variable for BMI, each 1 kg/m(2) increase in childhood BMI was predicted to result in a 6.5{\%} (95{\%} CI: 4.6-8.5{\%}) higher absolute risk of early menarche (before age 12 years). While mendelian randomisation analysis is dependent on a number of assumptions, our findings support a causal effect of BMI on early menarche and suggests that increasing prevalence of childhood obesity will lead to similar trends in the prevalence of early menarche.},

abstract = {Accurate measurement of the marginal healthcare costs associated with different diseases and health conditions is important, especially for increasingly prevalent conditions such as obesity. However, existing observational study designs cannot identify the causal impact of disease on healthcare costs. This paper explores the possibilities for causal inference offered by Mendelian randomization, a form of instrumental variable analysis that uses genetic variation as a proxy for modifiable risk exposures, to estimate the effect of health conditions on cost. Well-conducted genome-wide association studies provide robust evidence of the associations of genetic variants with health conditions or disease risk factors. The subsequent causal effects of these health conditions on cost can be estimated using genetic variants as instruments for the health conditions. This is because the approximately random allocation of genotypes at conception means that many genetic variants are orthogonal to observable and unobservable confounders. Datasets with linked genotypic and resource use information obtained from electronic medical records or from routinely collected administrative data are now becoming available and will facilitate this form of analysis. We describe some of the methodological issues that arise in this type of analysis, which we illustrate by considering how Mendelian randomization could be used to estimate the causal impact of obesity, a complex trait, on healthcare costs. We describe some of the data sources that could be used for this type of analysis. We conclude by considering the challenges and opportunities offered by Mendelian randomization for economic evaluation.},

abstract = {Mendelian randomization (MR) is a powerful tool in epidemiology that can be used to estimate the causal effect of an exposure on an outcome in the presence of unobserved confounding, by utilizing genetic variants that are instrumental variables (IVs) for the exposure. This has been extended to multivariable MR (MVMR) to estimate the effect of two or more exposures on an outcome.We use simulations and theory to clarify the interpretation of estimated effects in a MVMR analysis under a range of underlying scenarios, where a secondary exposure acts variously as a confounder, a mediator, a pleiotropic pathway and a collider. We then describe how instrument strength and validity can be assessed for an MVMR analysis in the single-sample setting, and develop tests to assess these assumptions in the popular two-sample summary data setting. We illustrate our methods using data from UK Biobank to estimate the effect of education and cognitive ability on body mass index.MVMR analysis consistently estimates the direct causal effect of an exposure, or exposures, of interest and provides a powerful tool for determining causal effects in a wide range of scenarios with either individual- or summary-level data.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: A high body mass index (BMI) is a major risk factor for several chronic diseases, but the biology underlying these associations is not well-understood. Dyslipidemia, inflammation, and elevated levels of growth factors and sex steroid hormones explain some of the increased disease risk, but other metabolic factors not yet identified may also play a role. DESIGN: In order to discover novel metabolic biomarkers of BMI, we used non-targeted metabolomics to assay 317 metabolites in blood samples from 947 participants and examined the cross-sectional associations between metabolite levels and BMI. Participants were from three studies in the United States and China. Height, weight, and potential confounders were ascertained by questionnaire (US studies) or direct measurement (Chinese study). Metabolite levels were measured using liquid-phase chromatography and gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. We evaluated study-specific associations using linear regression, adjusted for age, gender, and smoking, and we estimated combined associations using random effects meta-analysis. RESULTS: The meta-analysis revealed 37 metabolites significantly associated with BMI, including 19 lipids, 12 amino acids, and 6 others, at the Bonferroni significance threshold (p{\textless}0.00016). Eighteen of these associations had not been previously reported, including histidine, an amino acid neurotransmitter, and butyrylcarnitine, a lipid marker of whole-body fatty acid oxidation. Heterogeneity by study was minimal (all P(heterogeneity) {\textgreater}0.05). In total, 110 metabolites were associated with BMI at the p{\textless}0.05 level. CONCLUSION: These findings establish a baseline for the BMI metabolome, and suggest new targets for researchers attempting to clarify mechanistic links between high BMIs and disease risk.},

In simulation studies it is shown that the proposed test keeps the prescribed significance level much better than the commonly used tests in the fixed-effects and random-effects model, respectively. Moreover, when using the test it is not necessary to choose between fixed effects and random effects approaches in advance. The proposed method applies in the same way to the analysis of a controlled multi-centre study with binary outcome, including a possible interaction between drugs and centres.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Obesity and being overweight during adulthood have been consistently linked to increased risk for development of dementia later in life, especially Alzheimer's disease. They have also been associated with cognitive dysfunction and brain structural alterations in otherwise healthy adults. Although proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy may distinguish between neuronal and glial components of the brain and may point to neurobiological mechanisms underlying brain atrophy and cognitive changes, no spectroscopic studies have yet assessed the relationships between adiposity and brain metabolites. METHODS: We have utilized magnetic resonance imaging and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging data from 50 healthy middle-aged participants (mean age, 41.7 +/- 8.5 years; 17 women), who were scanned as control subjects for another study. RESULTS: After adjustment for age and sex, greater body mass indices (BMIs) correlated with: (1) lower concentrations of N-acetylaspartate (spectroscopic marker of neuronal viability) in frontal (p = 0.001), parietal (p = 0.006), and temporal (p = 0.008) white matter; (2) lower N-acetylaspartate in frontal gray matter (p = 0.01); and (3) lower concentrations of choline-containing metabolites (associated with membrane metabolism) in frontal white matter (p = 0.05). INTERPRETATION: These results suggest that increased BMI at midlife is associated with neuronal and/or myelin abnormalities, primarily in the frontal lobe. Because white matter in the frontal lobes is more prone to the effects of aging than in other lobes, our results may reflect accelerated aging in individuals with high levels of adiposity. Thus, greater BMI may increase the odds of developing an age-related disease, such as Alzheimer's disease.},

This study investigated the differences in metabolomic profiling between overweight/obese and normal-weight men. Overweight/obese (n=30) and age-matched, normal-weight men (n=30) were included. Anthropometric parameters, conventional metabolites, and biomarkers were measured. Metabolomic profiling was analyzed with UPLC-Q-TOF MS. Overweight/obese men showed higher levels of HOMA-IR, triglycerides, total cholesterol, and LDL-cholesterol, and lower levels of HDL-cholesterol and adiponectin than lean men. Overweight/obese men showed higher proportion of stearic acid and lower proportion of oleic acid in serum phospholipids. Additionally, overweight/obese individuals showed higher fat intake and lower ratio of polyunsaturated fatty acids to saturated fatty acids. We identified three lyso-phosphatidylcholine (lysoPC) as potential plasma markers and confirmed eight known metabolites for overweight/obesity men. Especially, overweight/obese subjects showed higher levels of lysoPC C14:0 and lysoPC C18:0 and lower levels of lysoPC C18:1 than lean subjects. Results confirmed abnormal metabolism of two branched-chain amino acids, two aromatic amino acids, and fatty acid synthesis and oxidation in overweight/obese men. Additionally, the amount of dietary saturated fat may influence the proportion of saturated fatty acids in serum phospholipids and the degree of saturation of the constituent acyl group of plasma lysoPC.},

However, several evidences consistently showed that genetics contributes significantly to the weight-gain susceptibility.A systematic literature search of most relevant original, review and meta-analysis, restricted to English was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science and Google scholar up to May 2017 concerning the contribution of genetics and environmental factors to obesity.Several evidences suggest that obesogenic environments contribute to the development of an obese phenotype. However, not every individual from the same population, despite sharing the same obesogenic environment, develop obesity.After more than 10 years of investigation on the genetics of obesity, the variants found associated with obesity represent only 3{\%} of the estimated BMI-heritability, which is around 47–80{\%}. Moreover, genetic factors per se were unable to explain the rapid spread of obesity prevalence.The integration of multi-omics data enables scientists having a better picture and to elucidate unknown pathways contributing to obesity.New studies based on case–control or gene candidate approach will be important to identify new variants associated with obesity susceptibility and consequently unveiling its genetic architecture. This will lead to an improvement of our understanding about underlying mechanisms involved in development and origin of the actual obesity epidemic. The integration of several omics will also provide insights about the interplay between genes and environments contributing to the obese phenotype.},

abstract = {There is widespread metabolic disruption in women upon becoming pregnant. South Asians (SA) compared to White Europeans (WE) have more fat mass and are more insulin-resistant at a given body mass index (BMI). Whether these are reflected in other gestational metabolomic differences is unclear. Our aim was to compare gestational metabolic profiles and their determinants between WE and SA women. We used data from a United Kingdom (UK) cohort to compare metabolic profiles and associations of maternal age, education, parity, height, BMI, tricep skinfold thickness, gestational diabetes (GD), pre-eclampsia, and gestational hypertension with 156 metabolic measurements in WE (n = 4072) and SA (n = 4702) women. Metabolic profiles, measured in fasting serum taken between 26-28 weeks gestation, were quantified by nuclear magnetic resonance. Distributions of most metabolic measures differed by ethnicity. WE women had higher levels of most lipoprotein subclasses, cholesterol, glycerides and phospholipids, monosaturated fatty acids, and creatinine but lower levels of glucose, linoleic acid, omega-6 and polyunsaturated fatty acids, and most amino acids. Higher BMI and having GD were associated with higher levels of several lipoprotein subclasses, triglycerides, and other metabolites, mostly with stronger associations in WEs. We have shown differences in gestational metabolic profiles between WE and SA women and demonstrated that associations of exposures with these metabolites differ by ethnicity.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In 2010, overweight and obesity were estimated to cause 3{\textperiodcentered}4 million deaths, 3{\textperiodcentered}9{\%} of years of life lost, and 3{\textperiodcentered}8{\%} of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) worldwide. The rise in obesity has led to widespread calls for regular monitoring of changes in overweight and obesity prevalence in all populations. Comparable, up-to-date information about levels and trends is essential to quantify population health effects and to prompt decision makers to prioritise action. We estimate the global, regional, and national prevalence of overweight and obesity in children and adults during 1980-2013. METHODS: We systematically identified surveys, reports, and published studies (n=1769) that included data for height and weight, both through physical measurements and self-reports. We used mixed effects linear regression to correct for bias in self-reports. We obtained data for prevalence of obesity and overweight by age, sex, country, and year (n=19,244) with a spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression model to estimate prevalence with 95{\%} uncertainty intervals (UIs). FINDINGS: Worldwide, the proportion of adults with a body-mass index (BMI) of 25 kg/m(2) or greater increased between 1980 and 2013 from 28{\textperiodcentered}8{\%} (95{\%} UI 28{\textperiodcentered}4-29{\textperiodcentered}3) to 36{\textperiodcentered}9{\%} (36{\textperiodcentered}3-37{\textperiodcentered}4) in men, and from 29{\textperiodcentered}8{\%} (29{\textperiodcentered}3-30{\textperiodcentered}2) to 38{\textperiodcentered}0{\%} (37{\textperiodcentered}5-38{\textperiodcentered}5) in women. Prevalence has increased substantially in children and adolescents in developed countries; 23{\textperiodcentered}8{\%} (22{\textperiodcentered}9-24{\textperiodcentered}7) of boys and 22{\textperiodcentered}6{\%} (21{\textperiodcentered}7-23{\textperiodcentered}6) of girls were overweight or obese in 2013. The prevalence of overweight and obesity has also increased in children and adolescents in developing countries, from 8{\textperiodcentered}1{\%} (7{\textperiodcentered}7-8{\textperiodcentered}6) to 12{\textperiodcentered}9{\%} (12{\textperiodcentered}3-13{\textperiodcentered}5) in 2013 for boys and from 8{\textperiodcentered}4{\%} (8{\textperiodcentered}1-8{\textperiodcentered}8) to 13{\textperiodcentered}4{\%} (13{\textperiodcentered}0-13{\textperiodcentered}9) in girls. In adults, estimated prevalence of obesity exceeded 50{\%} in men in Tonga and in women in Kuwait, Kiribati, Federated States of Micronesia, Libya, Qatar, Tonga, and Samoa. Since 2006, the increase in adult obesity in developed countries has slowed down. INTERPRETATION: Because of the established health risks and substantial increases in prevalence, obesity has become a major global health challenge. Not only is obesity increasing, but no national success stories have been reported in the past 33 years. Urgent global action and leadership is needed to help countries to more effectively intervene.

abstract = {Summary The specific effect of central rather than general obesity on breast cancer risk is not clear. This review examines the relationship between waist and waist?hip ratio (WHR) and risk of breast cancer in pre- and post-menopausal women using all available cohort and case-control data. The databases of the Cochrane Library, Medline, Cancer Lit and Embase were searched until October 2002. Relevant cohort and case-control studies with separate analyses in pre- and/or post-menopausal women were included. Random effects meta-analyses were carried out, subgrouped by pre- or post-menopausal status and cohort or case-control design. Sensitivity analyses were also performed. Five cohort studies with 72?1705 person years of observation (453 pre-menopausal and 2684 post-menopausal cases), and three case-control studies comprising 276 pre-menopausal cases with 758 pre-menopausal controls and 390 post-menopausal cases with 1071 post-menopausal controls were included. Pooled results from cohort studies using the most adjusted data [but without adjustment for weight or body mass index (BMI)] suggest a 39{\%} lower risk of breast cancer in post-menopausal women with the smallest waist (compared with the largest) and a 24{\%} lower risk in women with the smallest WHR. In pre-menopausal women, however, pooled results suggest that measurement of waist or WHR have little effect on risk of breast cancer. Adjustment for BMI abolished the relationship between waist or WHR and risk of post-menopausal breast cancer, but introduced such a relationship amongst pre-menopausal women. The relationship between a smaller measurement of waist or WHR and lower risk of post-menopausal breast cancer appears to result from the associated correlation with BMI. Amongst pre-menopausal women, central (not general) obesity may be specifically associated with an increased risk of breast cancer.},

abstract = {Adiponectin is the most abundant peptide secreted by adipocytes, whose reduction plays a central role in obesity-related diseases, including insulin resistance/type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. In addition to adipocytes, other cell types, such as skeletal and cardiac myocytes and endothelial cells, can also produce this adipocytokine. Adiponectin effects are mediated by adiponectin receptors, which occur as two isoforms (AdipoR1 and AdipoR2). Adiponectin has direct actions in liver, skeletal muscle, and the vasculature.Adiponectin exists in the circulation as varying molecular weight forms, produced by multimerization. Several endoplasmic reticulum ER-associated proteins, including ER oxidoreductase 1-$\alpha$ (Ero1-$\alpha$), ER resident protein 44 (ERp44), disulfide-bond A oxidoreductase-like protein (DsbA-L), and glucose-regulated protein 94 (GPR94), have recently been found to be involved in the assembly and secretion of higher-order adiponectin complexes. Recent data indicate that the high-molecular weight (HMW) complexes have the predominant action in metabolic tissues. Studies have shown that adiponectin administration in humans and rodents has insulin-sensitizing, anti-atherogenic, and anti-inflammatory effects, and, in certain settings, also decreases body weight. Therefore, adiponectin replacement therapy in humans may suggest potential versatile therapeutic targets in the treatment of obesity, insulin resistance/type 2 diabetes, and atherosclerosis. The current knowledge on regulation and function of adiponectin in obesity, insulin resistance, and cardiovascular disease is summarized in this review.},

Although environmental factors likely play a role, the reasons for this imbalanced sex ratio remain unresolved. AN displays high genetic correlations with anthropometric and metabolic traits. Given sex differences in body composition, we investigated the possible metabolic underpinnings of female propensity for AN. We conducted sex-specific GWAS in a healthy and medication-free subsample of the UK Biobank (n = 155,961), identifying 77 genome-wide significant loci associated with body fat percentage (BF{\%}) and 174 with fat-free mass (FFM). Partitioned heritability analysis showed an enrichment for central nervous tissue-associated genes for BF{\%}, which was more prominent in females than males. Genetic correlations of BF{\%} and FFM with the largest GWAS of AN by the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium were estimated to explore shared genomics. The genetic correlations of BF{\%}(male) and BF{\%}(female) with AN differed significantly from each other (p {\textless} .0001, $\delta$ = -0.17), suggesting that the female preponderance in AN may, in part, be explained by sex-specific anthropometric and metabolic genetic factors increasing liability to AN.},

Results from recently published cohort studies were also incorporated into the existing meta-analyses to update them with more recent data. Thus, the present study compiled all the relevant evidence accumulated to date, encompassing a total of 488 cohorts and over 30 million participants. MR studies were collected to identify any causal relationship between obesity and various CVD outcomes, and to avoid reverse causality. The degree of obesity was measured with BMI, WC, and WHR. The evidence levels of pooled results were graded into high, moderate, low, and very low according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework.Results An increase in BMI was associated with a higher risk of developing coronary heart disease, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, stroke, hypertension, aortic valve stenosis, pulmonary embolism, and venous thromboembolism; the study results corroborate the casual effect of obesity on the incidence of CVD, except stroke, based on MR studies. The increase in the risk of developing CVD for every 5 kg/m2 increase in BMI ranged from 7{\%} (relative risk [RR], 1.07; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 1.03 to 1.11) for stroke to 49{\%} (RR, 1.49; 95{\%} CI, 1.41 to 1.58) for hypertension. The risk of all-cause mortality and CVD-specific mortality increased with adiposity, which was supported by a high grade of evidence from observational analyses; however, the causal effect of obesity on mortality outcomes was not significant in MR studies.Conclusions Only 15 out of the 53 associations (28{\%}) reported for obesity and CVD outcomes were supported with high evidence levels from observational analyses. Although other reported associations might be valid, various degrees of uncertainty remain. The causal effect of obesity on 9 of the 14 CVD-related outcomes was corroborated by MR studies. As obesity is progressively increasing around the globe and because CVD remains a constant threat to public health, it is necessary to understand the gradient of evidence underlying the association between these two clinical entities. Any weak links in the association and causality discovered in this review should be reinforced with further scientific research, while high-certainty associations with established causality should be reflected in clinical practices and health policies.Systematic review registration PROSPERO CRD42020179469.Section 1 What is already known on this topic- Obesity is progressively increasing worldwide and cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains a continued threat to public health.- Although obesity as a risk factor for various cardiovascular outcomes has been studied for decades, the results from previous studies are heterogeneous, making it difficult for clinicians and policy makers to determine genuine and reliable associations.- The level of evidence underlying the associations between obesity and CVD remains unknown.Section 2: What this study adds- Only 15 of the 53 reported associations (28{\%}) between obesity and CVD outcomes are supported with a high level of evidence. While other associations may be genuine, various degrees of uncertainty remain.- An increase in body-mass index was associated with a higher risk of developing coronary heart disease, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, stroke, hypertension, aortic valve stenosis, pulmonary embolism, and venous thromboembolism; the casual effect of obesity on the incidence of CVD was corroborated by Mendelian randomisation (MR) studies, with the exception of stroke.- The increase in the risk of all-cause mortality and CVD-specific mortality with adiposity was supported by a high grade of evidence in observational analyses, but the causal effect of obesity on mortality outcomes was not significant in MR studies.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Clinical TrialPROSPERO CRD42020179469.Funding StatementThis work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korea government (MSIT) (No. 2019R1A2C4070496).Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:NOT applicable.

abstract = {Mendelian randomization (MR) provides us the opportunity to investigate the causal paths of metabolites in type 2 diabetes and glucose homeostasis. We developed and tested an MR approach based on genetic risk scoring for plasma metabolite levels, utilizing a pathway-based sensitivity analysis to control for nonspecific effects. We focused on 124 circulating metabolites that correlate with fasting glucose in the Erasmus Rucphen Family (ERF) study (n = 2,564) and tested the possible causal effect of each metabolite with glucose and type 2 diabetes and vice versa. We detected 14 paths with potential causal effects by MR, following pathway-based sensitivity analysis. Our results suggest that elevated plasma triglycerides might be partially responsible for increased glucose levels and type 2 diabetes risk, which is consistent with previous reports. Additionally, elevated HDL components, i.e., small HDL triglycerides, might have a causal role of elevating glucose levels. In contrast, large (L) and extra large (XL) HDL lipid components, i.e., XL-HDL cholesterol, XL-HDL–free cholesterol, XL-HDL phospholipids, L-HDL cholesterol, and L-HDL–free cholesterol, as well as HDL cholesterol seem to be protective against increasing fasting glucose but not against type 2 diabetes. Finally, we demonstrate that genetic predisposition to type 2 diabetes associates with increased levels of alanine and decreased levels of phosphatidylcholine alkyl-acyl C42:5 and phosphatidylcholine alkyl-acyl C44:4. Our MR results provide novel insight into promising causal paths to and from glucose and type 2 diabetes and underline the value of additional information from high-resolution metabolomics over classic biochemistry.},

Characterisation of this normal degree of variation in the metabolomic profiles of human biofluids is a necessary and important step in the development of metabolomics for use in nutrition-related research. The current review focuses on the impact of sex on the metabolomic profile. A number of studies have reported that sex impacts metabolites such as amino acids, lipids, sugars and keto acids. Furthermore, we examine the effect of the menstrual cycle on the metabolomic profile. Responses to dietary interventions can also differ between the sexes and highlighting this is important for the development of the field of precision nutrition.},

abstract = {Metabolomic profiling of obese versus lean humans reveals a branched-chain amino acid (BCAA)-related metabolite signature that is suggestive of increased catabolism of BCAA and correlated with insulin resistance. To test its impact on metabolic homeostasis, we fed rats on high-fat (HF), HF with supplemented BCAA (HF/BCAA), or standard chow (SC) diets. Despite having reduced food intake and a low rate of weight gain equivalent to the SC group, HF/BCAA rats were as insulin resistant as HF rats. Pair-feeding of HF diet to match the HF/BCAA animals or BCAA addition to SC diet did not cause insulin resistance. Insulin resistance induced by HF/BCAA feeding was accompanied by chronic phosphorylation of mTOR, JNK, and IRS1Ser307 and by accumulation of multiple acylcarnitines in muscle, and it was reversed by the mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin. Our findings show that in the context of a dietary pattern that includes high fat consumption, BCAA contributes to development of obesity-associated insulin resistance.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: We evaluated the associations of anthropometric indicators of general obesity (body mass index, BMI), an established risk factor of various cancer, and body fat distribution (waist circumference, WC; hip circumference, HC; and waist-to-hip ratio, WHR), which may better reflect metabolic complications of obesity, with total obesity-related and site-specific (colorectal and postmenopausal breast) cancer incidence. METHODS: This is a meta-analysis of seven prospective cohort studies participating in the CHANCES consortium including 18 668 men and 24 751 women with a mean age of 62 and 63 years, respectively. Harmonised individual participant data from all seven cohorts were analysed separately and alternatively for each anthropometric indicator using multivariable Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: After a median follow-up period of 12 years, 1656 first-incident obesity-related cancers (defined as postmenopausal female breast, colorectum, lower oesophagus, cardia stomach, liver, gallbladder, pancreas, endometrium, ovary, and kidney) had occurred in men and women. In the meta-analysis of all studies, associations between indicators of adiposity, per s.d. increment, and risk for all obesity-related cancers combined yielded the following summary hazard ratios: 1.11 (95{\%} CI 1.02-1.21) for BMI, 1.13 (95{\%} CI 1.04-1.23) for WC, 1.09 (95{\%} CI 0.98-1.21) for HC, and 1.15 (95{\%} CI 1.00-1.32) for WHR. Increases in risk for colorectal cancer were 16{\%}, 21{\%}, 15{\%}, and 20{\%}, respectively per s.d. of BMI, WC, HC, and WHR. Effect modification by hormone therapy (HT) use was observed for postmenopausal breast cancer (P(interaction){\textless}0.001), where never HT users showed an ∼20{\%} increased risk per s.d. of BMI, WC, and HC compared to ever users. CONCLUSIONS: BMI, WC, HC, and WHR show comparable positive associations with obesity-related cancers combined and with colorectal cancer in older adults. For postmenopausal breast cancer we report evidence for effect modification by HT use.},

abstract = {Author summary Obesity is increasing globally and has been linked to major causes of death, such as diabetes and heart disease. Still, the causal effects of obesity on other leading causes of death is relatively unexplored. It is also unclear if any such effects differ between men and women. Mendelian randomization is a method that explores causal relationships between traits using genetic data. Using Mendelian randomization, we investigated the effects of obesity traits on leading causes of death and assessed if any such effects differ between men and women. We found that obesity increases the risks of heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, diabetes, kidney disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and chronic liver disease. Higher body mass index led to a higher risk of type 2 diabetes in women than in men, whereas a higher waist-hip ratio increased risks of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and chronic kidney disease more in men than in women. In summary, obesity traits are causally involved in the majority of the leading causes of death, and some obesity traits affect disease risk differently in men and women. This has potential implications for public health strategies and indicates that sex-specific preventative measures may be needed.},

abstract = {Raised triglycerides (TG) and reduced high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) are components of metabolic syndrome. Both high TG and metabolic syndrome have been reported to be risk factors of endometrial cancer. Therefore, triglycerides-to-high density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (TG/HDL-c ratio) may be a useful biological indicator in managing endometrial cancer. We aimed to explore the association between pretreatment TG/HDL-c ratio and endometrial cancer in postmenopausal women, and to evaluate its potential role in the disease. Pretreatment serum lipid profile and TG/HDL-c ratio were retrospectively analyzed for 167 postmenopausal women with endometrial cancer and 464 matched noncancer controls. Compared with controls, pretreatment TG/HDL-c ratio in endometrial cancer patients significantly elevated regardless of whether patients had diabetes or overweight/obesity (P?{\textless}?0.05). Further analyses showed that pretreatment TG/HDL-c ratio increased significantly with advanced tumor stage. Interestingly, TG/HDL-c ratio of type I endometrial cancer patients was higher than those with type II endometrial cancer. A positive association was found between pretreatment TG/HDL-c ratio and tumor stage (adjusted r = 0.176, P?= 0.027) in endometrial cancer group. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis yielded the cut-off value of 1.52 for TG/HDL-c ratio to discriminate patients with cancer from controls (area under the curve, 0.689; sensitivity, 51.5{\%}; specificity, 84.1{\%}). Multivariate logistic regression model identified TG/HDL-c ratio?≥ 1.52 (odds ratio?= 4.123; P {\textless} 0.001) as an independent predictor of endometrial cancer. TG/HDL-c ratio was positively associated with endometrial cancer clinical features, such as tumor stage and pathogenetic type. Accordingly, pretreatment TG/HDL-c ratio might be a potential marker for endometrial cancer.},

Expansion of adipose tissue in obesity alters adipokine secretion which may contribute to the development of metabolic diseases. Consequently, this correlation has emphasized the importance to further characterize the adipocyte secretion profile, and several attempts have been made to characterize the complex nature of the adipose tissue secretome by utilizing diverse proteomic profiling approaches. Although the entirety of human adipokines is still incompletely characterized, to date more than 600 potentially secretory proteins were identified providing a rich source to identify putative novel biomarkers associated with metabolic diseases.},

There is a need for a more precise yet portable method of phenotyping and categorizing risk in large numbers of people with obesity to advance clinical care and drug development. Here, we used non-targeted metabolomics and whole-genome sequencing to identify metabolic and genetic signatures of obesity. We find that obesity results in profound perturbation of the metabolome; nearly a third of the assayed metabolites associated with changes in BMI. A metabolome signature identifies the healthy obese and lean individuals with abnormal metabolomes-these groups differ in health outcomes and underlying genetic risk. Specifically, an abnormal metabolome associated with a 2- to 5-fold increase in cardiovascular events when comparing individuals who were matched for BMI but had opposing metabolome signatures. Because metabolome profiling identifies clinically meaningful heterogeneity in obesity, this approach could help select patients for clinical trials.},

We use individual data from the UK Biobank study (N = 120,050) and summary data from large GWA studies of educational attainment, cognitive ability and smoking behaviour. Our results show that more years of education are associated with a reduced likelihood of smoking that is not due to an effect of general cognitive ability on smoking behaviour.

We aimed to evaluate the evidence of these associations and integrate results from different approaches to assess causal inference. We searched Medline and Embase for meta-analyses of observational studies, meta-analyses of randomized clinical trials (RCTs), and Mendelian randomization (MR) studies measuring the associations between non-genetic biomarkers and CRC risk and meta-analyses of RCTs on supplementary micronutrients. We repeated the meta-analyses using random-effects models and categorized the evidence based on predefined criteria. We described each MR study and evaluated their credibility. Seventy-two meta-analyses of observational studies and 18 MR studies on non-genetic biomarkers and six meta-analyses of RCTs on micronutrient intake and CRC risk considering 65, 42, and five unique associations, respectively, were identified. No meta-analyses of RCTs on blood level biomarkers have been found. None of the associations were classified as convincing or highly suggestive, three were classified as suggestive, and 26 were classified as weak. For three biomarkers explored in MR studies, there was evidence of causality and seven were classified as likely noncausal. For the first time, results from both observational and MR studies were integrated by triangulating the evidence for a wide variety of non-genetic biomarkers and CRC risk. At blood level, lower vitamin D, higher homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance, and human papillomavirus infection were associated with higher CRC risk while increased linoleic acid and oleic acid and decreased arachidonic acid were likely causally associated with lower CRC risk. No association was found convincing in both study types.},

Moreover obese individuals more often suffer from significant joint pains, disorders and it also has social as well as psychological impairments. It is high time that countries facing the problems of obesity initiate some intervention measures to monitor and control this growing epidemic.},

abstract = {Genome-wide association studies with metabolomics (mGWAS) identify genetically influenced metabotypes (GIMs), their ensemble defining the heritable part of every human's metabolic individuality. Knowledge of genetic variation in metabolism has many applications of biomedical and pharmaceutical interests, including the functional understanding of genetic associations with clinical end points, design of strategies to correct dysregulations in metabolic disorders and the identification of genetic effect modifiers of metabolic disease biomarkers. Furthermore, it has been shown that GIMs provide testable hypotheses for functional genomics and metabolomics and for the identification of novel gene functions and metabolite identities. mGWAS with growing sample sizes and increasingly complex metabolic trait panels are being conducted, allowing for more comprehensive and systems-based downstream analyses. The generated large datasets of genetic associations can now be mined by the biomedical research community and provide valuable resources for hypothesis-driven studies. In this review, we provide a brief summary of the key aspects of mGWAS, followed by an update of recently published mGWAS. We then discuss new approaches of integrating and exploring mGWAS results and finish by presenting selected applications of GIMs in recent studies.},

abstract = {Early genome-wide association studies (GWASs) led to the surprising discovery that, for typical complex traits, most of the heritability is due to huge numbers of common variants with tiny effect sizes. Previously, we argued that new models are needed to understand these patterns. Here, we provide a formal model in which genetic contributions to complex traits are partitioned into direct effects from core genes and indirect effects from peripheral genes acting in trans. We propose that most heritability is driven by weak trans-eQTL SNPs, whose effects are mediated through peripheral genes to impact the expression of core genes. In particular, if the core genes for a trait tend to be co-regulated, then the effects of peripheral variation can be amplified such that nearly all of the genetic variance is driven by weak trans effects. Thus, our model proposes a framework for understanding key features of the architecture of complex traits.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Guidelines for optimal weight in older persons are limited by uncertainty about the ideal body mass index (BMI) or the usefulness of alternative anthropometric measures. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the association of BMI (in kg/m(2)), waist circumference, and waist-hip ratio (WHR) with mortality and cause-specific mortality. DESIGN: Subjects aged {\textgreater}/=75 y (n = 14 833) from 53 family practices in the United Kingdom underwent a health assessment that included measurement of BMI and waist and hip circumferences; they also were followed up for mortality. RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 5.9 y, 6649 subjects died (46{\%} of circulatory causes). In nonsmoking men and women (90{\%} of the cohort), compared with the lowest quintile of BMI ({\textless}23 in men and {\textless}22.3 in women), adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for mortality were {\textless}1 for all other quintiles of BMI (P for trend = 0.0003 and 0.0001 in men and women, respectively). Increasing WHR was associated with increasing HRs in men and women (P for trend = 0.008 and 0.0002, respectively). BMI was not associated with circulatory mortality in men (P for trend = 0.667) and was negatively associated in women (P for trend = 0.004). WHR was positively related to circulatory mortality in both men and women (P for trend = 0.001 and 0.005, respectively). Waist circumference was not associated with all-cause or circulatory mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Current guidelines for BMI-based risk categories overestimate risks due to excess weight in persons aged {\textgreater}/=75 y. Increased mortality risk is more clearly indicated for relative abdominal obesity as measured by high WHR.},

Information was available on four CRP gene tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs3093077, rs1205, rs1130864, rs1800947), concentration of C reactive protein, and levels of other risk factors.Main outcome measures Risk ratios for coronary heart disease associated with genetically raised C reactive protein versus risk ratios with equivalent differences in C reactive protein concentration itself, adjusted for conventional risk factors and variability in risk factor levels within individuals.Results CRP variants were each associated with up to 30{\%} per allele difference in concentration of C reactive protein (P{\&}lt;10−34) and were unrelated to other risk factors. Risk ratios for coronary heart disease per additional copy of an allele associated with raised C reactive protein were 0.93 (95{\%} confidence interval 0.87 to 1.00) for rs3093077; 1.00 (0.98 to 1.02) for rs1205; 0.98 (0.96 to 1.00) for rs1130864; and 0.99 (0.94 to 1.03) for rs1800947. In a combined analysis, the risk ratio for coronary heart disease was 1.00 (0.90 to 1.13) per 1 SD higher genetically raised natural log (ln) concentration of C reactive protein. The genetic findings were discordant with the risk ratio observed for coronary heart disease of 1.33 (1.23 to 1.43) per 1 SD higher circulating ln concentration of C reactive protein in prospective studies (P=0.001 for difference).Conclusion Human genetic data indicate that C reactive protein concentration itself is unlikely to be even a modest causal factor in coronary heart disease.},

Methods We did a systematic search using PubMed and Scopus, from inception up to January 2017. Prospective cohort studies reporting the risk estimates of hypertension for three or more quantitative categories of indices of general and abdominal adiposity were included. Summary relative risks were calculated using random-effects models. Results Fifty-seven prospective cohort studies were included. Summary relative risks were 1.49 (95{\%} confidence interval [CI]: 1.41, 1.58; I2 = 97.4{\%}, n = 50) for a five-unit increment in body mass index, 1.27 (95{\%}CI: 1.15, 1.39; I2 = 95.0{\%}, n = 14) for a 10-cm increment in waist circumference, 1.16 (95{\%}CI: 1.09, 1.23; I2 = 77.8{\%}, n = 5) for weight gain equal to a one-unit increment in BMI, and 1.37 (95{\%}CI: 1.24, 1.51; I2 = 76.4{\%}, n = 8) and 1.74 (95{\%}CI: 1.35, 2.13; I2 = 58.9{\%}, n = 4) for a 0.1-unit increment in waist-to-hip ratio and waist-to-height ratio, respectively. The risk of hypertension increased continuously with increasing all anthropometric measures, and also along with weight gain.

We analyzed the effect of phenotypic assortment and social homogamy on spousal correlations for body height and body mass index (BMI, kg/m(2)). Our data derived from a questionnaire administered to the adult Finnish Twin Cohort in 1990 (response rate 77{\%}) yielding results from 922 monozygotic and 1697 dizygotic adult twin pairs who reported information about their body height and weight and that of their spouses. Assortative mating was evident for body height and BMI. For body height, the effects of social homogamy (0.24 in men and 0.29 in women) and phenotypic assortment (0.27 and 0.28, respectively) were about the same. For BMI, the effect of social homogamy was stronger (0.31 in men and 0.28 in women) than the effect of phenotypic assortment (0.13 in both men and women). When assortative mating was taken into account, shared environmental factors had no effect on phenotypic variation in body height or BMI. Our results show that assortative mating needs to be considered in population genetic studies of body height and weight.},

abstract = {Risk stratification for coronary heart disease (CHD) remains challenging because of the complex causative mechanism of the disease. Metabolomic profiling offers the potential to detect new biomarkers and improve CHD risk assessment.To evaluate the association between circulating metabolites and incident CHD in a large European cohort.This population-based study used the Biomarkers for Cardiovascular Risk Assessment in Europe (BiomarCaRE) case-cohort to measure circulating metabolites using a targeted approach in serum samples from 10 741 individuals without prevalent CHD. The cohort consisted of a weighted, random subcohort of the original cohort of more than 70 000 individuals. The case-cohort design was applied to 6 European cohorts: FINRISK97 (Finland), Monitoring of Trends and Determinants in Cardiovascular Diseases/Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg (MONICA/KORA; Germany), MONICA-Brianza and Moli-sani (Italy), DanMONICA (Denmark), and the Scottish Heart Health Extended Cohort (United Kingdom).Associations with time to CHD onset were assessed individually by applying weighted and adjusted Cox proportional hazard models. The association of metabolites with CHD onset was examined by C indices.In 10 741 individuals (4157 women [38.7{\%}]; median [interquartile range] age, 56.5 [49.2-62.2] years), 2166 incident CHD events (20.2{\%}) occurred over a median (interquartile range) follow-up time of 9.2 (4.5-15.0) years. Among the 141 metabolites analyzed, 24 were significantly associated with incident CHD at a nominal P value of .05, including phosphatidylcholines (PCs), lysoPCs, amino acids, and sphingolipids. Five PCs remained significant after correction for multiple testing: acyl-alkyl-PC C40:6 (hazard ratio [HR], 1.13 [95{\%} CI, 1.07-1.18]), diacyl-PC C40:6 (HR, 1.10 [95{\%} CI, 1.04-1.15]), acyl-alkyl-PC C38:6 (HR, 1.11 [95{\%} CI, 1.05-1.16]), diacyl-PC C38:6 (HR, 1.09 [95{\%} CI, 1.04-1.14]) and diacyl-PC C38:5 (HR, 1.10 [95{\%} CI, 1.05-1.16]). Lower levels of these metabolites were associated with increased risk of incident CHD. The strength of the associations competes with those of classic risk factors (C statistics: acyl-alkyl-PC C40:6, 0.756 [95{\%} CI, 0.738-0.774], diacyl-PC C40:6, 0.754 [95{\%} CI, 0.736-0.772], acyl-alkyl-PC C38:6, 0.755 [95{\%} CI, 0.736-0.773], diacyl-PC C38:6, 0.754 [95{\%} CI, 0.736-0.772]), diacyl-PC C38:5, 0.754 [95{\%} CI, 0.736-0.772]). Adding metabolites to a base risk model including classic risk factors high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and high-sensitivity troponin I did not improve discrimination by C statistics.Five PCs were significantly associated with increased risk of incident CHD and showed comparable discrimination with individual classic risk factors. Although these metabolites do not improve CHD risk assessment beyond that of classic risk factors, these findings hold promise for an improved understanding of the pathophysiology of CHD.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Body mass index (BMI) is criticized for not distinguishing fat from lean mass and ignoring fat distribution, leaving its ability to detect health effects unclear. OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to compare BMI with total and regional fat indexes from dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry in their associations with cardiometabolic traits. Duration of exposure to and change in each index across adolescence were examined in relation to detailed traits in young adulthood. METHODS BMI was examined alongside total, trunk, arm, and leg fat indexes (each in kilograms per square meter) from dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry at ages 10 and 18 years in relation to 230 traits from targeted metabolomics at age 18 years in 2,840 offspring from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. RESULTS Higher total fat mass index and BMI at age 10 years were similarly associated with cardiometabolic traits at age 18 years, including higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure, higher very low-density lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, higher triglycerides, and higher insulin and glycoprotein acetyls. Associations were stronger for both indexes measured at age 18 years and for gains in each index from age 10 to 18 years (e.g., 0.45 SDs [95{\%} confidence interval: 0.38 to 0.53] in glycoprotein acetyls per SD unit gain in fat mass index vs. 0.38 SDs [95{\%} confidence interval: 0.27 to 0.48] per SD unit gain in BMI). Associations resembled those for trunk fat index. Higher lean mass index was weakly associated with traits and was not protective against higher fat mass index. CONCLUSIONS The results of this study support abdominal fatness as a primary driver of cardiometabolic dysfunction and BMI as a useful tool for detecting its effects.},

abstract = {Objective: To investigate any correlation between BMI and brain gray matter volume, we analyzed 1,428 healthy Japanese subjects by applying volumetric analysis and voxel-based morphometry (VBM) using brain magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, which enables a global analysis of brain structure without a priori identification of a region of interest. Methods and Procedures: We collected brain MR images from 690 men and 738 women, and their height, weight, and other clinical information. The collected images were automatically normalized into a common standard space for an objective assessment of neuroanatomical correlations in volumetric analysis and VBM with BMI. Results: Volumetric analysis revealed a significant negative correlation in men (P {\textless} 0.001, adjusting for age, lifetime alcohol intake, history of hypertension, and diabetes mellitus), although not in women, between BMI and the gray matter ratio, which represents the percentage of gray matter volume in the intracranial volume. VBM revealed that, in men, the regional gray matter volume of the bilateral medial temporal lobes, anterior lobe of the cerebellum, occipital lobe, frontal lobe, precuneus, and midbrain showed significant negative correlations with BMI, while those of the bilateral inferior frontal gyri, posterior lobe of the cerebellum, frontal lobes, temporal lobes, thalami, and caudate heads showed significant positive correlations with BMI. Discussion: Global loss and regional alterations in gray matter volume occur in obese male subjects, suggesting that male subjects with a high BMI are at greater risk for future declines in cognition or other brain functions.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To explore the causal effect of time-varying z-BMI growth on early  menarche using Mendelian randomisation (MR); to identify critical adiposity predictors of early menarche; to compare the effects of birthweight and time-varying z-BMI growth as mediators of the path from genes to early menarche using mediation analysis. METHODS: We used data from the Taiwan Children Health Study with 21 obesity-related single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to yield genetic (instrumental variable)IVs for adiposity. Children with available data on genotyping, birthweight, adiposity, and menarcheal age were included. RESULTS: In MR analyses, results based on the time-varying z-BMI growth show more statistical power and capture more information of adiposity growth (p=0.01) than those based on single point z-BMI (p=0.02). Among adiposity measures, critical predictors of early menarche are fat free mass (RR=1.33, 95{\%} CI 1.07-1.65) and waist/height ratio (RR=1.27, 95{\%} CI 1.03-1.56). Other potential predictors of early menarche are sum of skinfold (RR=1.24, 95{\%} CI 1.03-1.48) and total body fat (RR=1.20, 95{\%} CI 1.05-1.38). In both one-mediation and multi-mediation analyses, time-varying z-BMI growth in the prepubertal years plays a crucial mediator in the pathway from the genes to early menarche. CONCLUSIONS: This study discovered that greater prepubertal adiposity growth is a crucial mediator in the path from genes to early menarche. For girls with genes positively associated with obesity; and/or of lower birthweight, a strategy to prevent childhood adiposity should be implemented in order to avoid early menarche development.},

abstract = {Identification of environmentally modifiable factors causally influencing disease risk is fundamental to public-health improvement strategies. Unfortunately, observational epidemiological studies are limited in their ability to reliably identify such causal associations, reflected in the many cases in which conventional epidemiological studies have apparently identified such associations that randomized controlled trials have failed to verify. The use of genetic variants as proxy measures of exposure ?an application of the Mendelian randomization principle?can contribute to strengthening causal inference. Genetic variants are not subject to bias due to reverse causation (disease processes influencing exposure, rather than vice versa) or recall bias, and if simple precautions are applied, they are not influenced by confounding or attenuation by errors. The principles of Mendelian randomization are illustrated with specific reference to studies of the effects of alcohol intake on various health-related outcomes through the utilization of genetic variants related to alcohol metabolism (in ALDH2 and ADH1B). Ways of incorporating Gene ? Environment interactions into the Mendelian randomization framework are developed, and the strengths and limitations of the approach discussed.},

Obesity has led to a dramatic increase in the incidence of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) among children and adolescents over the past 2 decades. Obesity is strongly associated with insulin resistance, which, when coupled with relative insulin deficiency, leads to the development of overt T2DM. Children and adolescents with T2DM may experience the microvascular and macrovascular complications of this disease at younger ages than individuals who develop diabetes in adulthood, including atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, stroke, myocardial infarction, and sudden death; renal insufficiency and chronic renal failure; limb-threatening neuropathy and vasculopathy; and retinopathy leading to blindness. Health care professionals are advised to perform the appropriate screening in children at risk for T2DM, diagnose the condition as early as possible, and provide rigorous management of the disease.},

abstract = {Background Blood-based or urinary biomarkers may play a role in quantifying the future risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and in understanding possible aetiological pathways to disease. However, no systematic review has been conducted that has identified and provided an overview of available biomarkers for incident T2D. We aimed to systematically review the associations of biomarkers with risk of developing T2D and to highlight evidence gaps in the existing literature regarding the predictive and aetiological value of these biomarkers and to direct future research in this field. Methods and Findings We systematically searched PubMed MEDLINE (January 2000 until March 2015) and Embase (until January 2016) databases for observational studies of biomarkers and incident T2D according to the 2009 PRISMA guidelines. We also searched availability of meta-analyses, Mendelian randomisation and prediction research for the identified biomarkers. We reviewed 3910 titles (705 abstracts) and 164 full papers and included 139 papers from 69 cohort studies that described the prospective relationships between 167 blood-based or urinary biomarkers and incident T2D. Only 35 biomarkers were reported in large scale studies with more than 1000 T2D cases, and thus the evidence for association was inconclusive for the majority of biomarkers. Fourteen biomarkers have been investigated using Mendelian randomisation approaches. Only for one biomarker was there strong observational evidence of association and evidence from genetic association studies that was compatible with an underlying causal association. In additional search for T2D prediction, we found only half of biomarkers were examined with formal evidence of predictive value for a minority of these biomarkers. Most biomarkers did not enhance the strength of prediction, but the strongest evidence for prediction was for biomarkers that quantify measures of glycaemia. Conclusions This study presents an extensive review of the current state of the literature to inform the strategy for future interrogation of existing and newly described biomarkers for T2D. Many biomarkers have been reported to be associated with the risk of developing T2D. The evidence of their value in adding to understanding of causal pathways to disease is very limited so far. The utility of most biomarkers remains largely unknown in clinical prediction. Future research should focus on providing good genetic instruments across consortia for possible biomarkers in Mendelian randomisation, prioritising biomarkers for measurement in large-scale cohort studies and examining predictive utility of biomarkers for a given context.},

abstract = {Summary Excess bodyweight is the sixth most important risk factor contributing to the overall burden of disease worldwide. 1{\textperiodcentered}1 billion adults and 10{\%} of children are now classified as overweight or obese. Average life expectancy is already diminished; the main adverse consequences are cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and several cancers. The complex pathological processes reflect environmental and genetic interactions, and individuals from disadvantaged communities seem to have greater risks than more affluent individuals partly because of fetal and postnatal imprinting. Obesity, with its array of comorbidities, necessitates careful clinical assessment to identify underlying factors and to allow coherent management. The epidemic reflects progressive secular and age-related decreases in physical activity, together with substantial dietary changes with passive over-consumption of energy despite the neurobiological processes controlling food intake. Effective long-term weight loss depends on permanent changes in dietary quality, energy intake, and activity. Neither the medical management nor the societal preventive challenges are currently being met.},

We confirmed a previously established adiposity locus in FTO (P = 3 × 10(-26)) and identified two new loci associated with body fat percentage, one near IRS1 (P = 4 × 10(-11)) and one near SPRY2 (P = 3 × 10(-8)). Both loci contain genes with potential links to adipocyte physiology. Notably, the body-fat-decreasing allele near IRS1 is associated with decreased IRS1 expression and with an impaired metabolic profile, including an increased visceral to subcutaneous fat ratio, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, risk of diabetes and coronary artery disease and decreased adiponectin levels. Our findings provide new insights into adiposity and insulin resistance.},

abstract = {Background Metabolomics is the rapidly evolving field of the comprehensive measurement of ideally all endogenous metabolites in a biological fluid. However, no single analytic technique covers the entire spectrum of the human metabolome. Here we present results from a multiplatform study, in which we investigate what kind of results can presently be obtained in the field of diabetes research when combining metabolomics data collected on a complementary set of analytical platforms in the framework of an epidemiological study.  Methodology/Principal Findings 40 individuals with self-reported diabetes and 60 controls (male, over 54 years) were randomly selected from the participants of the population-based KORA (Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg) study, representing an extensively phenotyped sample of the general German population. Concentrations of over 420 unique small molecules were determined in overnight-fasting blood using three different techniques, covering nuclear magnetic resonance and tandem mass spectrometry. Known biomarkers of diabetes could be replicated by this multiple metabolomic platform approach, including sugar metabolites (1,5-anhydroglucoitol), ketone bodies (3-hydroxybutyrate), and branched chain amino acids. In some cases, diabetes-related medication can be detected (pioglitazone, salicylic acid).  Conclusions/Significance Our study depicts the promising potential of metabolomics in diabetes research by identification of a series of known and also novel, deregulated metabolites that associate with diabetes. Key observations include perturbations of metabolic pathways linked to kidney dysfunction (3-indoxyl sulfate), lipid metabolism (glycerophospholipids, free fatty acids), and interaction with the gut microflora (bile acids). Our study suggests that metabolic markers hold the potential to detect diabetes-related complications already under sub-clinical conditions in the general population.},

abstract = {Metabolomics is becoming common in epidemiology due to recent developments in quantitative profiling technologies and appealing results from their applications for understanding health and disease. Our team has developed an automated high-throughput serum NMR metabolomics platform that provides quantitative molecular data on 14 lipoprotein subclasses, their lipid concentrations and composition, apolipoprotein A-I and B, multiple cholesterol and triglyceride measures, albumin, various fatty acids as well as on numerous low-molecular-weight metabolites, including amino acids, glycolysis related measures and ketone bodies. The molar concentrations of these measures are obtained from a single serum sample with costs comparable to standard lipid measurements. We have analyzed almost 250 000 samples from around 100 epidemiological cohorts and biobanks and the new international set-up of multiple platforms will allow an annual throughput of more than 250 000 samples. The molecular data have been used to study type 1 and type 2 diabetes etiology as well as to characterize the molecular reflections of the metabolic syndrome, long-term physical activity, diet and lipoprotein metabolism. The results have revealed new biomarkers for early atherosclerosis, type 2 diabetes, diabetic nephropathy, cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality. We have also combined genomics and metabolomics in diverse studies. We envision that quantitative high-throughput NMR metabolomics will be incorporated as a routine in large biobanks; this would make perfect sense both from the biological research and cost point of view - the standard output of over 200 molecular measures would vastly extend the relevance of the sample collections and make many separate clinical chemistry assays redundant.},

However, alternative approaches, focusing on non-European ancestry populations, more refined adiposity measures, and low-frequency (minor allele frequency (MAF){\textless}5{\%}) coding variants, identified additional novel loci that had not been identified before. Loci associated with overall obesity implicate pathways that act in the brain, whereas loci associated with fat distribution point to pathways involved in adipocyte biology.

Adipose tissue not only responds to afferent signals from traditional hormone systems and the central nervous system but also expresses and secretes factors with important endocrine functions. These factors include leptin, other cytokines, adiponectin, complement components, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, proteins of the renin-angiotensin system, and resistin. Adipose tissue is also a major site for metabolism of sex steroids and glucocorticoids.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The built environment might be associated with development of obesity and related disorders. We examined whether neighbourhood exposure to fast-food outlets and physical activity facilities were associated with adiposity in UK adults. METHODS: We used cross-sectional observational data from UK Biobank. Participants were aged 40-70 years and attended 21 assessment centres between 2006 and 2010. Using linked data on environments around each participant's residential address, we examined whether density of physical activity facilities and proximity to fast-food outlets were associated with waist circumference, body-mass index (BMI), and body fat percentage. We used multilevel linear regression models adjusted for potential confounders, and conducted several sensitivity analyses. FINDINGS: Complete case sample sizes were 401 917 (waist circumference models), 401 435 (BMI), and 395 640 (body fat percentage). Greater density of physical activity facilities within 1000 m of home was independently associated with smaller waist circumference and lower BMI and body fat percentage. Compared with people with no nearby facilities, those with at least six facilities close to home had 1{\textperiodcentered}22 cm smaller waist circumference (95{\%} CI -1{\textperiodcentered}64 to -0{\textperiodcentered}80), 0{\textperiodcentered}57 kg/m(2) lower BMI (-0{\textperiodcentered}74 to -0{\textperiodcentered}39), and 0{\textperiodcentered}81 percentage points lower body fat (-1{\textperiodcentered}03 to -0{\textperiodcentered}59). Living further from a fast-food outlet was weakly associated with waist circumference and BMI, mostly among women. Compared with people living fewer than 500 m from a fast-food outlet, those living at least 2000 m away had 0{\textperiodcentered}26 cm smaller waist circumference (-0{\textperiodcentered}52 to 0{\textperiodcentered}01). INTERPRETATION: This study shows strong associations between high densities of physical activity facilities and lower adiposity for adults in mid-life. We observed weaker associations for access to fast food, but these are likely to be underestimated owing to limitations of the food environment measure. Policy makers should consider interventions aimed at tackling the obesogenic built environment. FUNDING: Commonwealth Scholarship Commission, Wellcome Trust Institutional Strategic Support Fund.},

The prognosis of EC strongly depends on tumor stage, hence the importance of improving diagnosis. Metabolomics has recently appeared as a promising test for a non-invasive diagnosis of several diseases. Nevertheless, no metabolic marker has been approved for use in the routine practice. We aimed to provide an overview of metabolomics findings in the diagnosis of EC. Material and methods A systematic review was performed by searching eight electronic databases from their inception to October 2019 for studies assessing metabolomics in EC diagnosis. Extracted data included characteristics of patients and EC, serum concentration of metabolites in women with and without EC and its association with EC diagnosis, tumor behavior and pathological characteristics. Results Six studies with 732 women (356 cases and 376 controls) were included. Several metabolites were found able to predict the presence of EC, tumor behavior (progression and recurrence) and pathological characteristics (histotype, myometrial invasion and lymph vascular space invasion). Conclusions Metabolomics might be suitable for a non-invasive diagnosis and screening of EC, offering the possibility to predict tumor behavior and pathological characteristics.

We studied the impact of body composition on the risk of functional limitation in COPD. METHODS: We used bioelectrical impedance to estimate body composition in a cohort of 355 younger adults with COPD who had a broad spectrum of severity. RESULTS: Among women, a higher lean-to-fat ratio was associated with a lower risk of self-reported functional limitation after controlling for age, height, pulmonary function impairment, race, education, and smoking history (OR 0.45 per 0.50 increment in lean-to-fat ratio; 95{\%} CI 0.28 to 0.74). Among men, a higher lean-to-fat ratio was associated with a greater distance walked in 6 minutes (mean difference 40 meters per 0.50 ratio increment; 95{\%} CI 9 to 71 meters). In women, the lean-to-fat ratio was associated with an even greater distance walked (mean difference 162 meters per 0.50 increment; 95{\%} CI 97 to 228 meters). In women, higher lean-to-fat ratio was also associated with better Short Physical Performance Battery Scores. In further analysis, the accumulation of greater fat mass, and not the loss of lean mass, was most strongly associated with functional limitation among both sexes. CONCLUSION: Body composition is an important non-pulmonary impairment that modulates the risk of functional limitation in COPD, even after taking pulmonary function into account. Body composition abnormalities may represent an important area for screening and preventive intervention in COPD.},

abstract = {AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: The extent to which effects of BMI on CHD are mediated by glycaemic and lipid risk factors is unclear. In this study we examined the effects of these traits using genetic evidence. METHODS: We used two-sample Mendelian randomisation to determine: (1) the causal effect of BMI on CHD (60,801 case vs 123,504 control participants), type 2 diabetes (34,840 case vs 114,981 control participants), fasting glucose (n = 46,186), insulin (n = 38,238), HbA(1c) (n = 46,368) and LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and triacylglycerols (n = 188,577); (2) the causal effects of glycaemic and lipids traits on CHD; and (3) the extent to which these traits mediate any effect of BMI on CHD. RESULTS: One SD higher BMI ({\~{}} 4.5 kg/m(2)) was associated with higher risk of CHD (OR 1.45 [95{\%} CI 1.27, 1.66]) and type 2 diabetes (1.96 [95{\%} CI 1.35, 2.83]), higher levels of fasting glucose (0.07 mmol/l [95{\%} CI 0.03, 0.11]), HbA(1c) (0.05{\%} [95{\%} CI 0.01, 0.08]), fasting insulin (0.18 log pmol/l [95{\%} CI 0.14, 0.22]) and triacylglycerols (0.20 SD [95{\%} CI 0.14, 0.26]) and lower levels of HDL-cholesterol (-0.23 SD [95{\%} CI -0.32, -0.15]). There was no evidence for a causal relation between BMI and LDL-cholesterol. The causal associations of higher triacylglycerols, HbA(1c) and diabetes risk with CHD risk remained after performing sensitivity analyses that considered different models of horizontal pleiotropy. The BMI-CHD effect reduced from 1.45 to 1.16 (95{\%} CI 0.99, 1.36) and to 1.36 (95{\%} CI 1.19, 1.57) with genetic adjustment for triacylglycerols or HbA(1c), respectively, and to 1.09 (95{\%} CI 0.94, 1.27) with adjustment for both. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Increased triacylglycerol levels and poor glycaemic control appear to mediate much of the effect of BMI on CHD.},

Results indicate that, under certain conditions, using knowledge of corresponding beta coefficients to impute missing correlations (effect sizes) generally produces relatively accurate and precise population effect-size estimates. Potential benefits from applying this knowledge include smaller sampling errors because of increased numbers of effect sizes and smaller nonsampling errors because of the inclusion of a broader array of research designs.},

abstract = {Inflammatory processes are involved in the pathogenesis of the most common chronic non-communicable diseases and may also play an important initiating role in their development. Only recently have inflammatory markers been included in epidemiological studies focusing on nutritional status, body composition and physical activity. We are just starting to understand how different lifestyles can determine basal levels of inflammatory biomarkers in early ages. This review aims to summarise what is known about the relationships between lifestyle-related determinants (focusing on overweight, physical activity and dietary habits) and inflammatory markers in apparently healthy young populations. Obesity is the most widely studied determinant. Several large-scale studies have now demonstrated that healthy young subjects with more body fat or higher BMI have moderately higher concentrations of inflammatory markers than their leaner peers, supporting the idea that obesity should be considered as a state of chronic low-grade inflammation. Less data is available to allow us to elucidate how physical activity/fitness or dietary patterns may have a direct effect on inflammation in apparently healthy, disease-free young populations. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Authors.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE The obesity paradox in which overweight/obesity is associated with mortality benefits is believed to be explained by confounding and reverse causality rather than by a genuine clinical benefit of excess body weight. We aimed to gain deeper insights into the paradox through analyzing mortality relationships with several adiposity measures; assessing subgroups with type 2 diabetes, with coronary heart disease (CHD), with cancer, and by smoking status; and adjusting for several confounders.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We studied the general UK Biobank population (N = 502,631) along with three subgroups of people with type 2 diabetes (n = 23,842), CHD (n = 24,268), and cancer (n = 45,790) at baseline. A range of adiposity exposures were considered, including BMI (continuous and categorical), waist circumference, body fat percentage, and waist-to-hip ratio, and the outcome was all-cause mortality. We used Cox regression models adjusted for age, smoking status, deprivation index, education, and disease history.RESULTS For BMI, the obesity paradox was observed among people with type 2 diabetes (adjusted hazard ratio for obese vs. normal BMI 0.78 [95{\%} CI 0.65, 0.95]) but not among those with CHD (1.00 [0.86, 1.17]). The obesity paradox was pronounced in current smokers, absent in never smokers, and more pronounced in men than in women. For other adiposity measures, there was less evidence for an obesity paradox, yet smoking status consistently modified the adiposity-mortality relationship.CONCLUSIONS The obesity paradox was observed in people with type 2 diabetes and is heavily modified by smoking status. The results of subgroup analyses and statistical adjustments are consistent with reverse causality and confounding.},

abstract = {Observational cohort studies can provide rich datasets with a diverse range of phenotypic variables. However, hypothesis-driven epidemiological analyses by definition only test particular hypotheses chosen by researchers. Furthermore, observational analyses may not provide robust evidence of causality, as they are susceptible to confounding, reverse causation and measurement error. Using body mass index (BMI) as an exemplar, we demonstrate a novel extension to the phenome-wide association study (pheWAS) approach, using automated screening with genotypic instruments to screen for causal associations amongst any number of phenotypic outcomes. We used a sample of 8,121 children from the ALSPAC dataset and tested the linear association of a BMI-associated allele score with 172 phenotypic outcomes (with variable sample sizes). We also performed an instrumental variable analysis to estimate the causal effect of BMI on each phenotype. We found 21 of the 172 outcomes were associated with the allele score at an unadjusted p {\textless} 0.05 threshold and use Bonferroni corrections, permutation testing and estimates of the false discovery rate to consider the strength of results given the number of tests performed. The most strongly associated outcomes included leptin, lipid profile and blood pressure. We also found novel evidence of effects of BMI on a global self-worth score.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Adiposity is a strong risk factor for cancer incidence and mortality. However, most of the evidence available has focused on body mass index (BMI) as a marker of adiposity. There is limited evidence on relationships of cancer with other adiposity markers, and if these associations are linear or not. The aim of this study was to investigate the associations of six adiposity markers with incidence and mortality from 24 cancers by accounting for potential non-linear associations. METHODS: A total of 437,393 participants (53.8{\%} women; mean age 56.3 years) from the UK Biobank prospective cohort study were included in this study. The median follow-up was 8.8 years (interquartile range 7.9 to 9.6) for mortality and 9.3 years (IQR 8.6 to 9.9) for cancer incidence. Adiposity-related exposures were BMI, body fat percentage, waist-hip ratio, waist-height ratio, and waist and hip circumference. Incidence and mortality of 24 cancers sites were the outcomes. Cox proportional hazard models were used with each of the exposure variables fitted separately on penalised cubic splines. RESULTS: During follow-up, 47,882 individuals developed cancer and 11,265 died due to cancer during the follow-up period. All adiposity markers had similar associations with overall cancer incidence. BMI was associated with a higher incidence of 10 cancers (stomach cardia (hazard ratio per 1 SD increment 1.35, (95{\%} CI 1.23; 1.47)), gallbladder (1.33 (1.12; 1.58)), liver (1.27 (1.19; 1.36)), kidney (1.26 (1.20; 1.33)), pancreas (1.12 (1.06; 1.19)), bladder (1.09 (1.04; 1.14)), colorectal (1.10 (1.06; 1.13)), endometrial (1.73 (1.65; 1.82)), uterine (1.68 (1.60; 1.75)), and breast cancer (1.08 (1.05; 1.11))) and overall cancer (1.03 (1.02; 1.04)). All these associations were linear except for breast cancer in postmenopausal women. Similar results were observed when other markers of central and overall adiposity were used. For mortality, nine cancer sites were linearly associated with BMI and eight with waist circumference and body fat percentage. CONCLUSION: Adiposity, regardless of the marker used, was associated with an increased risk in 10 cancer sites.},

abstract = {This year marks the 20th anniversary of the discovery of leptin, which has tremendously stimulated translational obesity research. The discovery of leptin has led to realizations that have established adipose tissue as an endocrine organ, secreting bioactive molecules including hormones now termed adipokines. Through adipokines, the adipose tissue influences the regulation of several important physiological functions including but not limited to appetite, satiety, energy expenditure, activity, insulin sensitivity and secretion, glucose and lipid metabolism, fat distribution, endothelial function, hemostasis, blood pressure, neuroendocrine regulation, and function of the immune system. Adipokines have a great potential for clinical use as potential therapeutics for obesity, obesity related metabolic, cardiovascular and other diseases. After 20 years of intense research efforts, recombinant leptin and the leptin analog metreleptin are already available for the treatment of congenital leptin deficiency and lipodystrophy. Other adipokines are also emerging as promising candidates for urgently needed novel pharmacological treatment strategies not only in obesity but also other disease states associated with and influenced by adipose tissue size and activity. In addition, prediction of reduced type 2 diabetes risk by high circulating adiponectin concentrations suggests that adipokines have the potential to be used as biomarkers for individual treatment success and disease progression, to monitor clinical responses and to identify non-responders to anti-obesity interventions. With the growing number of adipokines there is an increasing need to define their function, molecular targets and translational potential for the treatment of obesity and other diseases. In this review we present research data on adipose tissue secreted hormones, the discovery of which followed the discovery of leptin 20 years ago pointing to future research directions to unravel mechanisms of action for adipokines.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Metabolomics is a well-established tool in systems biology, especially in the top-down approach. Metabolomics experiments often results in discovery studies that provide intriguing biological hypotheses but rarely offer mechanistic explanation of such findings. In this light, the interpretation of metabolomics data can be boosted by deploying systems biology approaches. OBJECTIVES: This review aims to provide an overview of systems biology approaches that are relevant to metabolomics and to discuss some successful applications of these methods. METHODS: We review the most recent applications of systems biology tools in the field of metabolomics, such as network inference and analysis, metabolic modelling and pathways analysis. RESULTS: We offer an ample overview of systems biology tools that can be applied to address metabolomics problems. The characteristics and application results of these tools are discussed also in a comparative manner. CONCLUSIONS: Systems biology-enhanced analysis of metabolomics data can provide insights into the molecular mechanisms originating the observed metabolic profiles and enhance the scientific impact of metabolomics studies.},

abstract = {Identification of adipose-specific genes has contributed to an understanding of mechanisms underlying adipocyte development and obesity. Herein, our analyses of the recent Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) database revealed 38 adipose-specific/enhanced protein coding genes, among which 3 genes were novel adipose-specific, and 414 highly differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between subcutaneous and omental adipose depots. By integrative analyses of genome-wide association studies (GWASs), 14 adipose-specific/enhanced genes and 60 DEGs were found to be associated with obesity-related traits and diseases, consolidating evidence for contribution of these genes to the regional fat distribution and obesity phenotypes. In addition, expression of HOXC cluster was up-regulated in subcutaneous adipose tissue, and the majority of the HOXB cluster was expressed highly in omental adipose tissue, indicating differential expression patterns of HOX clusters in adipose depots. Our findings on the distinct gene expression profiles in adipose tissue and their relation to obesity provide an important foundation for future functional biological studies and therapeutic targets in obesity and associated diseases.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Synthesis of multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in a systematic review can summarize the effects of individual outcomes and provide numerical answers about the effectiveness of interventions. Filtering of searches is time consuming, and no single method fulfills the principal requirements of speed with accuracy. Automation of systematic reviews is driven by a necessity to expedite the availability of current best evidence for policy and clinical decision-making. We developed Rayyan ( http://rayyan.qcri.org ), a free web and mobile app, that helps expedite the initial screening of abstracts and titles using a process of semi-automation while incorporating a high level of usability. For the beta testing phase, we used two published Cochrane reviews in which included studies had been selected manually. Their searches, with 1030 records and 273 records, were uploaded to Rayyan. Different features of Rayyan were tested using these two reviews. We also conducted a survey of Rayyan's users and collected feedback through a built-in feature. RESULTS: Pilot testing of Rayyan focused on usability, accuracy against manual methods, and the added value of the prediction feature. The "taster" review (273 records) allowed a quick overview of Rayyan for early comments on usability. The second review (1030 records) required several iterations to identify the previously identified 11 trials. The "suggestions" and "hints," based on the "prediction model," appeared as testing progressed beyond five included studies. Post rollout user experiences and a reflexive response by the developers enabled real-time modifications and improvements. The survey respondents reported 40{\%} average time savings when using Rayyan compared to others tools, with 34{\%} of the respondents reporting more than 50{\%} time savings. In addition, around 75{\%} of the respondents mentioned that screening and labeling studies as well as collaborating on reviews to be the two most important features of Rayyan. As of November 2016, Rayyan users exceed 2000 from over 60 countries conducting hundreds of reviews totaling more than 1.6M citations. Feedback from users, obtained mostly through the app web site and a recent survey, has highlighted the ease in exploration of searches, the time saved, and simplicity in sharing and comparing include-exclude decisions. The strongest features of the app, identified and reported in user feedback, were its ability to help in screening and collaboration as well as the time savings it affords to users. CONCLUSIONS: Rayyan is responsive and intuitive in use with significant potential to lighten the load of reviewers.},

Increased adiposity in postmenopausal women may trigger signaling pathways that induce aromatase expression. In breast adipose fibroblasts, increased TNF production may induce the distal aromatase promoter, whereas increased local PGE(2) production may induce the proximal promoter region. We review here the mechanisms that control aromatase gene expression in breast adipose tissue, and the paracrine interactions between malignant breast epithelial cells and the surrounding adipose fibroblasts. Systematic characterization of these signaling pathways will facilitate the identification of potential drug targets to selectively reduce aromatase expression and excessive estrogen production, with therapeutic benefit.},

abstract = {Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) comprises multiple phenotypes such as airflow obstruction, emphysema, and frequent episodes of acute worsening of respiratory symptoms, known as exacerbations. The goal of this pilot study was to test the usefulness of unbiased metabolomics and transcriptomics approaches to delineate biological pathways associated with COPD phenotypes and outcomes. Blood was collected from 149 current or former smokers with or without COPD and separated into peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and plasma. PBMCs and plasma were analyzed using microarray and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry, respectively. Statistically significant transcripts and compounds were mapped to pathways using IMPaLA. Results showed that glycerophospholipid metabolism was associated with worse airflow obstruction and more COPD exacerbations. Sphingolipid metabolism was associated with worse lung function outcomes and exacerbation severity requiring hospitalizations. The strongest associations between a pathway and a certain COPD outcome were: fat digestion and absorption and T cell receptor signaling with lung function outcomes; antigen processing with exacerbation frequency; arginine and proline metabolism with exacerbation severity; and oxidative phosphorylation with emphysema. Overlaying transcriptomic and metabolomics datasets across pathways enabled outcome and phenotypic differences to be determined. Findings are relevant for identifying molecular targets for animal intervention studies and early intervention markers in human cohorts.},

We aimed to investigate if these associations are causal, using Mendelian randomization (MR) methods.Methods: The associations of BMI with cardiovascular outcomes [coronary heart disease (CHD), heart failure and ischaemic stroke], and associations of a genetic score (32 BMI single nucleotide polymorphisms) with BMI and cardiovascular outcomes were examined in up to 22 193 individuals with 3062 incident cardiovascular events from nine prospective follow-up studies within the ENGAGE consortium. We used random-effects meta-analysis in an MR framework to provide causal estimates of the effect of adiposity on cardiovascular outcomes.Results: There was a strong association between BMI and incident CHD (HR = 1.20 per SD-increase of BMI, 95{\%} CI, 1.12–1.28, P = 1.9{\textperiodcentered}10−7), heart failure (HR = 1.47, 95{\%} CI, 1.35–1.60, P = 9{\textperiodcentered}10−19) and ischaemic stroke (HR = 1.15, 95{\%} CI, 1.06–1.24, P = 0.0008) in observational analyses. The genetic score was robustly associated with BMI ($\beta$ = 0.030 SD-increase of BMI per additional allele, 95{\%} CI, 0.028–0.033, P = 3{\textperiodcentered}10−107). Analyses indicated a causal effect of adiposity on development of heart failure (HR = 1.93 per SD-increase of BMI, 95{\%} CI, 1.12–3.30, P = 0.017) and ischaemic stroke (HR = 1.83, 95{\%} CI, 1.05–3.20, P = 0.034). Additional cross-sectional analyses using both ENGAGE and CARDIoGRAMplusC4D data showed a causal effect of adiposity on CHD.Conclusions: Using MR methods, we provide support for the hypothesis that adiposity causes CHD, heart failure and, previously not demonstrated, ischaemic stroke.},

abstract = {Background: The strongest known risk factor for endometrial cancer is obesity. To determine whether SNPs associated with increased body mass index (BMI) or waist–hip ratio (WHR) are associated with endometrial cancer risk, independent of measured BMI, we investigated relationships between 77 BMI and 47 WHR SNPs and endometrial cancer in 6,609 cases and 37,926 country-matched controls.Methods: Logistic regression analysis and fixed effects meta-analysis were used to test for associations between endometrial cancer risk and (i) individual BMI or WHR SNPs, (ii) a combined weighted genetic risk score (wGRS) for BMI or WHR. Causality of BMI for endometrial cancer was assessed using Mendelian randomization, with BMIwGRS as instrumental variable.Results: The BMIwGRS was significantly associated with endometrial cancer risk (P = 3.4 × 10−17). Scaling the effect of the BMIwGRS on endometrial cancer risk by its effect on BMI, the endometrial cancer OR per 5 kg/m2 of genetically predicted BMI was 2.06 [95{\%} confidence interval (CI), 1.89–2.21], larger than the observed effect of BMI on endometrial cancer risk (OR = 1.55; 95{\%} CI, 1.44–1.68, per 5 kg/m2). The association attenuated but remained significant after adjusting for BMI (OR = 1.22; 95{\%} CI, 1.10–1.39; P = 5.3 × 10−4). There was evidence of directional pleiotropy (P = 1.5 × 10−4). BMI SNP rs2075650 was associated with endometrial cancer at study-wide significance (P {\&}lt; 4.0 × 10−4), independent of BMI. Endometrial cancer was not significantly associated with individual WHR SNPs or the WHRwGRS.Conclusions: BMI, but not WHR, is causally associated with endometrial cancer risk, with evidence that some BMI-associated SNPs alter endometrial cancer risk via mechanisms other than measurable BMI.Impact: The causal association between BMI SNPs and endometrial cancer has possible implications for endometrial cancer risk modeling.

This association was replicated in the TAG consortium data (1.19 (1.06 to 1.33), P=0.003). Furthermore, each standard deviation increment in body mass index was estimated to increase smoking intensity by 0.88 cigarettes per day (95{\%} confidence interval 0.50 to 1.26, P{\&}lt;0.001) in UK Biobank and 1.27 cigarettes per day in the TAG consortium (0.46 to 2.07, P=0.002).

A relationship between COPD and obesity is increasingly recognised, although the nature of this association remains unknown. This review focuses on the epidemiology of obesity in COPD and the impact of excessive fat mass on lung function, exercise capacity and prognosis. The evidence for altered adipose tissue functions in obesity—including reduced lipid storage capacity, altered expression and secretion of inflammatory factors, adipose tissue hypoxia and macrophage infiltration in adipose tissue—is also reviewed. The interrelationship between these factors and their contribution to the development of insulin resistance in obesity is considered. It is proposed that, in patients with COPD, reduced oxidative capacity and systemic hypoxia may amplify these disturbances, not only in obese patients but also in subjects with hidden loss of fat-free mass. The potential interaction between abnormal adipose tissue function, systemic inflammation and COPD may provide more insight into the pathogenesis and reversibility of systemic pathology in this disease.},

METHODS: Narrative review of the publications of the NHS and NHS II between 1976 and 2016. RESULTS: Long-term NHS research has shown that weight gain and being overweight or obese are important risk factors for type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, certain types of cancers, and premature death. The cohorts have elucidated the role of dietary and lifestyle factors in obesity, especially sugar-sweetened beverages, poor diet quality, physical inactivity, prolonged screen time, short sleep duration or shift work, and built environment characteristics. Genome-wide association and gene-lifestyle interaction studies have shown that genetic factors predispose individuals to obesity but that such susceptibility can be attenuated by healthy lifestyle choices. This research has contributed to evolving clinical and public health guidelines on the importance of limiting weight gain through healthy dietary and lifestyle behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: The NHS cohorts have contributed to our understanding of the risk factors for and consequences of obesity and made a lasting impact on clinical and public health guidelines on obesity prevention.},

METHODS AND RESULTS: We applied multivariable regression in ≤5909 adults and Mendelian randomization (using cis-acting genetic variants in the vicinity of the adiponectin gene as instrumental variables) for analyzing the causal effect of adiponectin in the metabolic profile of ≤37 545 adults. Participants were largely European from 6 longitudinal studies and 1 genome-wide association consortium. In the multivariable regression analyses, higher circulating adiponectin was associated with higher high-density lipoprotein lipids and lower very-low-density lipoprotein lipids, glucose levels, branched-chain amino acids, and inflammatory markers. However, these findings were not supported by Mendelian randomization analyses for most metabolites. Findings were consistent between sexes and after excluding high-risk groups (defined by age and occurrence of previous cardiovascular event) and 1 study with admixed population. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that blood adiponectin concentration is more likely to be an epiphenomenon in the context of metabolic disease than a key determinant.},

abstract = {Meta-analysis in the presence of unexplained heterogeneity is frequently undertaken by using a random-effects model, in which the effects underlying different studies are assumed to be drawn from a normal distribution. Here we discuss the justification and interpretation of such models, by addressing in turn the aims of estimation, prediction and hypothesis testing. A particular issue that we consider is the distinction between inference on the mean of the random-effects distribution and inference on the whole distribution. We suggest that random-effects meta-analyses as currently conducted often fail to provide the key results, and we investigate the extent to which distribution-free, classical and Bayesian approaches can provide satisfactory methods. We conclude that the Bayesian approach has the advantage of naturally allowing for full uncertainty, especially for prediction. However, it is not without problems, including computational intensity and sensitivity to a priori judgements. We propose a simple prediction interval for classical meta-analysis and offer extensions to standard practice of Bayesian meta-analysis, making use of an example of studies of 'set shifting' ability in people with eating disorders.},

abstract = {Summary The WHO 2016 report indicates that worldwide obesity is rising, with over 600 million people in the obese range (BMI{\textgreater}30). The recommended daily calorie intake for adults is 2000 kcal and 2500 kcal for women and men respectively. The average American consumes 3770 kcal/day and the average person in the UK consumes 3400 kcal/day. With such increased caloric intake, there is an increased load on metabolic pathways, in particular glucose metabolism. Such metabolism requires micronutrients as enzyme co-factors. The recommended daily allowance (RDA) for thiamine is 1.3 mg/day and 0.5 mg thiamine is required to process 1000 kilocalories (kcal). Therefore, despite the appearance of being overfed, there is now increasing evidence that the obese population may nutritionally depleted of essential micronutrients. Thiamine deficiency has been reported to be in the region of 16–47{\%} among patients undergoing bariatric surgery for obesity. Thiamine, in turn, requires magnesium to be in its active form thiamine diphosphate, (TDP). TDP also requires magnesium to achieve activation of TDP dependent enzymes, including transketolase (TK), pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and alpha-keto glutaric acid dehydrogenase (AKGDH), during metabolism of glucose. Thiamine and magnesium therefore play a critical role in glucose metabolism and their deficiency may result in the accumulation of anaerobic metabolites including lactate due to a mismatch between caloric burden and function of thiamine dependent enzymes. It may therefore be postulated that thiamine and magnesium deficiency are under-recognized in obesity and may be important in the progress of obesity and obesity related chronic disease states. The aim of the present systematic review was to examine the role of thiamine dependent enzymes in obesity and obesity related chronic disease states.},

abstract = {Obesity and depression are major public health concerns that are both associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. There is a considerable body of literature linking obesity to the development of depression. Recent studies using Mendelian randomization indicate that this relationship is causal. Most studies of the obesity–depression association have used body mass index as a measure of obesity. Body mass index is defined as weight (measured in kilograms) divided by the square of height (meters) and therefore does not distinguish between the contributions of fat and nonfat to body weight. To better understand the obesity–depression association, we conduct a Mendelian randomization study of the relationship between fat mass, nonfat mass, height, and depression, using genome-wide association study results from the UK Biobank (n = 332,000) and the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (n = 480,000). Our findings suggest that both fat mass and height (short stature) are causal risk factors for depression, while nonfat mass is not. These results represent important new knowledge on the role of anthropometric measures in the etiology of depression. They also suggest that reducing fat mass will decrease the risk of depression, which lends further support to public health measures aimed at reducing the obesity epidemic.},

In this review, we investigate the current role of mass spectrometry-based metabolomics in cancer research. A literature review was carried out within the databases PubMed, Embase, and Web of Knowledge. We included 106 studies reporting on 21 different types of cancer in 7 different sample types. Metabolomics in cancer research is most often used for case-control comparisons. Secondary applications include translational areas, such as patient prognosis, therapy control and tumor classification, or grading. Metabolomics is at a developmental stage with respect to epidemiology, with the majority of studies including less than 100 patients. Standardization is required especially concerning sample preparation and data analysis. In the second part of this review, we reconstructed a metabolic network of patients with cancer by quantitatively extracting all reports of altered metabolites: Alterations in energy metabolism, membrane, and fatty acid synthesis emerged, with tryptophan levels changed most frequently in various cancers. Metabolomics has the potential to evolve into a standard tool for future applications in epidemiology and translational cancer research, but further, large-scale studies including prospective validation are needed.},

To test its impact on metabolic homeostasis, we fed rats on high-fat (HF), HF with supplemented BCAA (HF/BCAA), or standard chow (SC) diets. Despite having reduced food intake and a low rate of weight gain equivalent to the SC group, HF/BCAA rats were as insulin resistant as HF rats. Pair-feeding of HF diet to match the HF/BCAA animals or BCAA addition to SC diet did not cause insulin resistance. Insulin resistance induced by HF/BCAA feeding was accompanied by chronic phosphorylation of mTOR, JNK, and IRS1Ser307 and by accumulation of multiple acylcarnitines in muscle, and it was reversed by the mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin. Our findings show that in the context of a dietary pattern that includes high fat consumption, BCAA contributes to development of obesity-associated insulin resistance.},

abstract = {Abstract Objective: To investigate whether the association between BMI and all-cause mortality could be disentangled into opposite effects of body fat and fat-free mass (FFM). Research Methods and Procedures: All-cause mortality was studied in the Danish follow-up study ?Diet, Cancer and Health? with 27, 178 men and 29, 875 women 50 to 64 years old recruited from 1993 to 1997. By the end of year 2001, the median follow-up was 5.8 years, and 1851 had died. Body composition was assessed by bioelectrical impedance. Cox regression models were used to estimate the relationships among body fat mass index (body fat mass divided by height squared), FFM index (FFM divided by height squared), and mortality. All analyses were adjusted for smoking habits. Results: Men and women showed similar associations. J-shaped associations were found between body fat mass index and mortality adjusted for FFM and smoking. The mortality rate ratios in the upper part of body fat mass were 1.12 per kg/m2 (95{\%} confidence interval: 1.07, 1.18) in men and 1.06 per kg/m2 (95{\%} confidence interval: 1.02, 1.10) in women. Reversed J-shaped associations were found between FFM index and mortality with a tendency to level off for high values of FFM. Discussion: Our findings suggest that BMI represents joint but opposite associations of body fat and FFM with mortality. Both high body fat and low FFM are independent predictors of all-cause mortality.},

abstract = {Obesity has a complex relationship to breast cancer risk that differs in  premenopausal and postmenopausal women. Before the menopause, the level of adiposity is inversely related to risk, indicative of a protective effect, whereas in postmenopausal women, particularly the elderly, the association is a positive one, consistent with obesity being a risk factor. The importance of high estrogen production in adipose tissue, with consequent elevation of circulating biologically available estradiol, in the promotional effect of obesity on postmenopausal breast carcinogenesis is well established; the resulting tumors express both estrogen and progesterone receptors. The mechanism(s) for the protective effect in premenopausal women is less well understood, but the breast cancers that do develop in the presence of obesity are most often estrogen and progesterone receptor negative, consistent with the selection of non-estrogen-dependent tumor cells which are dependent on growth factors such as insulin, insulin-like growth factor-I and some adipokines. The influence of menopausal status on the relationships between adiposity and breast cancer appears to be modified within each category by age; the protective effect before the menopause may be limited to younger women ({\textless}35 years), and the adverse effect was found to apply specifically to older postmenopausal women. Although randomized trials of weight reduction for postmenopausal breast cancer prevention have not been performed, observational studies suggested that risk reduction does occur; in addition, other health benefits of weight control need to be considered regardless of menopausal status.},

Our aim was to generate estimates of the association between plasma CRP and metabolic syndrome phenotypes that were free from confounding and reverse causation, to assess the causal role of this protein. METHODS: We examined associations between serum CRP concentration and metabolic syndrome phenotypes in the British Women's Heart and Health Study. We then compared these estimates with those derived from a mendelian randomised framework with common CRP gene haplotypes to generate unconfounded and unbiased estimates of any causal associations. FINDINGS: In a sample of British women, body-mass index (BMI), systolic blood pressure, waist-to-hip ratio, serum concentrations of HDL cholesterol and triglycerides, and insulin resistance were all associated with plasma CRP concentration. CRP haplotypes were associated with plasma CRP concentration (p{\textless}0.0001). With instrumental variable analyses, there was no association between plasma CRP concentration and any of the metabolic syndrome phenotypes analysed. There was strong evidence that linear regression and mendelian randomisation based estimation gave conflicting results for the CRP-BMI association (p=0.0002), and some evidence of conflicting results for the association of CRP with the score for insulin resistance (p=0.0139), triglycerides (p=0.0313), and HDL cholesterol (p=0.0688). INTERPRETATION: Disparity between estimates of the association between plasma CRP and phenotypes comprising the metabolic syndrome derived from conventional analyses and those from a mendelian randomisation approach suggests that there is no causal association between CRP and the metabolic syndrome phenotypes.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Various risk factors have been associated with epithelial ovarian cancer risk in observational epidemiological studies. However, the causal nature of the risk factors reported, and thus their suitability as effective intervention targets, is unclear given the susceptibility of conventional observational designs to residual confounding and reverse causation. Mendelian randomization (MR) uses genetic variants as proxies for risk factors to strengthen causal inference in observational studies. We used MR to evaluate the association of 12 previously reported risk factors (reproductive, anthropometric, clinical, lifestyle, and molecular factors) with risk of invasive epithelial ovarian cancer, invasive epithelial ovarian cancer histotypes, and low malignant potential tumours. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Genetic instruments to proxy 12 risk factors were constructed by identifying single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were robustly (P {\textless} 5 × 10-8) and independently associated with each respective risk factor in previously reported genome-wide association studies. These risk factors included genetic liability to 3 factors (endometriosis, polycystic ovary syndrome, type 2 diabetes) scaled to reflect a 50{\%} higher odds liability to disease. We obtained summary statistics for the association of these SNPs with risk of overall and histotype-specific invasive epithelial ovarian cancer (22,406 cases; 40,941 controls) and low malignant potential tumours (3,103 cases; 40,941 controls) from the Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium (OCAC). The OCAC dataset comprises 63 genotyping project/case-control sets with participants of European ancestry recruited from 14 countries (US, Australia, Belarus, Germany, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Norway, Canada, Poland, UK, Spain, Netherlands, and Sweden). SNPs were combined into multi-allelic inverse-variance-weighted fixed or random effects models to generate effect estimates and 95{\%} confidence intervals (CIs). Three complementary sensitivity analyses were performed to examine violations of MR assumptions: MR-Egger regression and weighted median and mode estimators. A Bonferroni-corrected P value threshold was used to establish strong evidence (P {\textless} 0.0042) and suggestive evidence (0.0042 {\textless} P {\textless} 0.05) for associations. In MR analyses, there was strong or suggestive evidence that 2 of the 12 risk factors were associated with invasive epithelial ovarian cancer and 8 of the 12 were associated with 1 or more invasive epithelial ovarian cancer histotypes. There was strong evidence that genetic liability to endometriosis was associated with an increased risk of invasive epithelial ovarian cancer (odds ratio [OR] per 50{\%} higher odds liability: 1.10, 95{\%} CI 1.06-1.15; P = 6.94 × 10-7) and suggestive evidence that lifetime smoking exposure was associated with an increased risk of invasive epithelial ovarian cancer (OR per unit increase in smoking score: 1.36, 95{\%} CI 1.04-1.78; P = 0.02). In analyses examining histotypes and low malignant potential tumours, the strongest associations found were between height and clear cell carcinoma (OR per SD increase: 1.36, 95{\%} CI 1.15-1.61; P = 0.0003); age at natural menopause and endometrioid carcinoma (OR per year later onset: 1.09, 95{\%} CI 1.02-1.16; P = 0.007); and genetic liability to polycystic ovary syndrome and endometrioid carcinoma (OR per 50{\%} higher odds liability: 0.89, 95{\%} CI 0.82-0.96; P = 0.002). There was little evidence for an association of genetic liability to type 2 diabetes, parity, or circulating levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D and sex hormone binding globulin with ovarian cancer or its subtypes. The primary limitations of this analysis include the modest statistical power for analyses of risk factors in relation to some less common ovarian cancer histotypes (low grade serous, mucinous, and clear cell carcinomas), the inability to directly examine the association of some ovarian cancer risk factors that did not have robust genetic variants available to serve as proxies (e.g., oral contraceptive use, hormone replacement therapy), and the assumption of linear relationships between risk factors and ovarian cancer risk. CONCLUSIONS: Our comprehensive examination of possible aetiological drivers of ovarian carcinogenesis using germline genetic variants to proxy risk factors supports a role for few of these factors in invasive epithelial ovarian cancer overall and suggests distinct aetiologies across histotypes. The identification of novel risk factors remains an important priority for the prevention of epithelial ovarian cancer.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Overweight and obesity are frequently associated with preventable death and have emerged as a major challenge to public health. There is an ongoing debate on the role of abdominal obesity and its value in predicting cardiovascular and renal outcomes. The present analysis evaluates the prevalence of microalbuminuria (MAU) and conventional cardiovascular risk factors in relation to measures of general and abdominal obesity. METHODS: In this multinational, observational study, 20828 hypertensive out-patients from 26 countries including Europe, North and Latin America, Middle East, and Asia were analyzed. Urinary dipstick screening for MAU was performed as well as data on patient demographics, anthropometric measures, cardiovascular risk factors, comorbid conditions, and cardiovascular drug therapy collected. MAU prevalence was determined by a stepwise logistic regression analysis with cardiovascular risk factors as univariate. RESULTS: In the univariate analysis, MAU prevalence systematically increased with body mass index (BMI) from 54.4{\%} (1st tertial) to 62.1{\%} (3rd tertial) (p {\textless} 0.0001), an increase which was also observed for waist circumference (WC). At any level of BMI, MAU increased with WC from 53.5{\%}, 54.8{\%}, and 55.0{\%} (1st tertial of WC in all three BMI tertials) to 61.4{\%}, 62.1{\%}, and 64.0{\%} (3rd tertial of WC in all BMI tertials) (p {\textless} 0.0001). In the multivariate analysis, WC, but not BMI was independently associated with MAU. Furthermore, overweight/obesity were associated with the presence of modifiable and nonmodifiable risk factors. CONCLUSION: An abnormal WC, but not BMI appears to be independently associated with MAU, an early marker of cardiovascular and renal risk. Increasing WC confers an incremental risk for MAU at any level of BMI, underlining the prognostic importance of abdominal fat accumulation beyond general obesity.},

abstract = {The relationship between high-density lipoproteins (HDLs), HDL-cholesterol (HDLC) and cancer incidence and mortality is controversial. Although most studies conducted so far, including well-designed prospective studies and meta-analyses, have revealed a significant inverse association between HDL-C levels and cancer risk, several confounding factors and opposite results showing either a direct or an inverse association between HDL-C levels and cancer mortality have hindered the possibility to derive definitive conclusions. Moreover, different lines of research also pointed out that this association might actually reflect an inverse causality, which would imply that low HDL-C levels merely represent an epiphenomenon of cancer-related inflammation and cancer cell renewal. Accordingly, the pharmacological increase of plasma HDL-C levels in large lipid modifying trials has not resulted in an amelioration of cancer-related outcomes. In such an intricate scenario, we conducted a comprehensive review of the literature with the aim to provide a wide perspective on the association between HDLs, mild and extreme changes in plasma HDL-C levels and cancer incidence and mortality, touching upon the certainties, the failures and the open issues in this intriguing area of research.},

abstract = {Obesity is considered the most important risk and prognostic factor for  estrogen-dependent breast cancer in postmenopausal women. Adipokines, in particular leptin, are at the center of the etiopathogenetic mechanisms by which obesity and related metabolic disorders influence breast cancer risk and its prognosis. The present prospective observational study aims to investigate the relationship between body mass index (BMI), serum levels of leptin and proinflammatory cytokines, and breast cancer prognostic factors. In the study, 98 postmenopausal and 82 premenopausal patients with ER-positive breast cancer participated. During the same study period, 221 control subjects were simultaneously recruited. Women underwent baseline measurements pre-operatively, before any surgical and systemic treatments. Pathologic characteristics of tumors were abstracted from pathology reports. Leptin and proinflammatory cytokines were assayed in stored fasting blood specimens. In postmenopausal breast cancer patients, BMI, leptin, and interleukin-6 significantly correlated with pathological tumor classification (pT) and TNM stage. Multivariate regression analysis showed that BMI and leptin, but not interleukin-6, were independent predictive variables of pT and TNM stage. Our results seem to suggest a twofold role of leptin in the etiopathogenesis of postmenopausal estrogen-positive breast cancer. Indeed, leptin reflects the total amount of fat mass, which correlates to aromatase activity and subsequent estrogens levels. Further studies are warranted to clarify the role of leptin and interleukin-6 in breast carcinogenesis and identify new therapeutic options, beyond the use of aromatase inhibitors, acting selectively on adipokine-driven pathways.},

abstract = {Metabolomics is the study of low molecular weight molecules or metabolites produced within cells and biological systems. It involves technologies such as mass spectrometry (MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) that can measure hundreds of thousands of unique chemical entities (UCEs). The metabolome provides one of the most accurate reflections of cellular activity at the functional level and can be leveraged to discern mechanistic information during normal and disease states. The advantages of metabolomics over other “omics” include its high sensitivity and ability to enable the analysis of relatively few metabolites compared with the number of genes and messenger RNAs (mRNAs). In clinical samples, metabolites are more stable than proteins or RNA. In fact, metabolomic profiling in basic, epidemiologic, clinical, and translational studies has revealed potential new biomarkers of disease and therapeutic outcome and has led to a novel mechanistic understanding of pathogenesis. These potential biomarkers include novel metabolites associated with cancer initiation, regression, and recurrence. Unlike genomics or even proteomics, however, the degree of metabolite complexity and heterogeneity within biological systems presents unique challenges that require specialized skills and resources to overcome. This article discusses epidemiologic studies of altered metabolite profiles in several cancers as well as challenges in the field and potential approaches to overcoming them.},

abstract = {Across scientific disciplines, there is a rapidly growing recognition of the need for more statistically robust, transparent approaches to data visualization. Complementary to this, many scientists have called for plotting tools that accurately and transparently convey key aspects of statistical effects and raw data with minimal distortion. Previously common approaches, such as plotting conditional mean or median barplots together with error-bars have been criticized for distorting effect size, hiding underlying patterns in the raw data, and obscuring the assumptions upon which the most commonly used statistical tests are based. Here we describe a data visualization approach which overcomes these issues, providing maximal statistical information while preserving the desired 'inference at a glance' nature of barplots and other similar visualization devices. These "raincloud plots" can visualize raw data, probability density, and key summary statistics such as median, mean, and relevant confidence intervals in an appealing and flexible format with minimal redundancy. In this tutorial paper, we provide basic demonstrations of the strength of raincloud plots and similar approaches, outline potential modifications for their optimal use, and provide open-source code for their streamlined implementation in R, Python and Matlab ( https://github.com/RainCloudPlots/RainCloudPlots).

abstract = {Insulinemia and type 2 diabetes (T2D) have been associated with endometrial cancer risk in numerous observational studies. However, the causality of these associations is uncertain. Here we use a Mendelian randomization (MR) approach to assess whether insulinemia and T2D are causally associated with endometrial cancer.We used single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with T2D (49 variants), fasting glucose (36 variants), fasting insulin (18 variants), early insulin secretion (17 variants), and body mass index (BMI) (32 variants) as instrumental variables in MR analyses. We calculated MR estimates for each risk factor with endometrial cancer using an inverse-variance weighted method with SNP-endometrial cancer associations from 1287 case patients and 8273 control participants.Genetically predicted higher fasting insulin levels were associated with greater risk of endometrial cancer (odds ratio [OR] per standard deviation = 2.34, 95{\%} confidence internal [CI] = 1.06 to 5.14, P = .03). Consistently, genetically predicted higher 30-minute postchallenge insulin levels were also associated with endometrial cancer risk (OR = 1.40, 95{\%} CI = 1.12 to 1.76, P = .003). We observed no associations between genetic risk of type 2 diabetes (OR = 0.91, 95{\%} CI = 0.79 to 1.04, P = .16) or higher fasting glucose (OR = 1.00, 95{\%} CI = 0.67 to 1.50, P = .99) and endometrial cancer. In contrast, endometrial cancer risk was higher in individuals with genetically predicted higher BMI (OR = 3.86, 95{\%} CI = 2.24 to 6.64, P = 1.2x10-6).This study provides evidence to support a causal association of higher insulin levels, independently of BMI, with endometrial cancer risk.},

In this study we examined the effects of these traits using genetic evidence. METHODS: We used two-sample Mendelian randomisation to determine: (1) the causal effect of BMI on CHD (60,801 case vs 123,504 control participants), type 2 diabetes (34,840 case vs 114,981 control participants), fasting glucose (n = 46,186), insulin (n = 38,238), HbA(1c) (n = 46,368) and LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and triacylglycerols (n = 188,577); (2) the causal effects of glycaemic and lipids traits on CHD; and (3) the extent to which these traits mediate any effect of BMI on CHD. RESULTS: One SD higher BMI ({\~{}} 4.5 kg/m(2)) was associated with higher risk of CHD (OR 1.45 [95{\%} CI 1.27, 1.66]) and type 2 diabetes (1.96 [95{\%} CI 1.35, 2.83]), higher levels of fasting glucose (0.07 mmol/l [95{\%} CI 0.03, 0.11]), HbA(1c) (0.05{\%} [95{\%} CI 0.01, 0.08]), fasting insulin (0.18 log pmol/l [95{\%} CI 0.14, 0.22]) and triacylglycerols (0.20 SD [95{\%} CI 0.14, 0.26]) and lower levels of HDL-cholesterol (-0.23 SD [95{\%} CI -0.32, -0.15]). There was no evidence for a causal relation between BMI and LDL-cholesterol. The causal associations of higher triacylglycerols, HbA(1c) and diabetes risk with CHD risk remained after performing sensitivity analyses that considered different models of horizontal pleiotropy. The BMI-CHD effect reduced from 1.45 to 1.16 (95{\%} CI 0.99, 1.36) and to 1.36 (95{\%} CI 1.19, 1.57) with genetic adjustment for triacylglycerols or HbA(1c), respectively, and to 1.09 (95{\%} CI 0.94, 1.27) with adjustment for both. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Increased triacylglycerol levels and poor glycaemic control appear to mediate much of the effect of BMI on CHD.},

In this study, we investigated the metabolic disorders of uncomplicated obesity to identify early alterations in biological systems. METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: Metabolic differences between overweight/obese (n=36) and normal-weight (n=35) young Chinese men without known metabolic disorders were assessed. Metabolic profiling of the serum and urine was performed using ultra-performance liquidchromatography quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF-MS). Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) was undertaken to reveal and classify the differences between the two groups. RESULTS: Compared to normal-weight men, obese men had higher levels of the serum metabolites phenylalanine, Phe-Phe, and L-tryptophan, whereas those of p-cresol sulfate and p-cresol were less in obesity. Urinary metabolites phenylacetamide, L-glutamine, phenylacetylglutamine, indoxyl sulfate, p-cresol, and p-cresol sulfate were greater in obese men. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that disorders involving aromatic amino acids and the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) have microbiomic involvement in the uncomplicated phase of obesity.},

Average life expectancy is already diminished; the main adverse consequences are cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and several cancers. The complex pathological processes reflect environmental and genetic interactions, and individuals from disadvantaged communities seem to have greater risks than more affluent individuals partly because of fetal and postnatal imprinting. Obesity, with its array of comorbidities, necessitates careful clinical assessment to identify underlying factors and to allow coherent management. The epidemic reflects progressive secular and age-related decreases in physical activity, together with substantial dietary changes with passive over-consumption of energy despite the neurobiological processes controlling food intake. Effective long-term weight loss depends on permanent changes in dietary quality, energy intake, and activity. Neither the medical management nor the societal preventive challenges are currently being met.},

However, to date, only a few metabolic studies based on large samples are available. Here, we provide novel and specific information on age-related metabolite concentration changes in human homeostasis. We report results from two population-based studies: the KORA F4 study from Germany as a discovery cohort, with 1038 female and 1124 male participants (32-81 years), and the TwinsUK study as replication, with 724 female participants. Targeted metabolomics of fasting serum samples quantified 131 metabolites by FIA-MS/MS. Among these, 71/34 metabolites were significantly associated with age in women/men (BMI adjusted). We further identified a set of 13 independent metabolites in women (with P values ranging from 4.6 × 10(-04) to 7.8 × 10(-42) , $\alpha$(corr) = 0.004). Eleven of these 13 metabolites were replicated in the TwinsUK study, including seven metabolite concentrations that increased with age (C0, C10:1, C12:1, C18:1, SM C16:1, SM C18:1, and PC aa C28:1), while histidine decreased. These results indicate that metabolic profiles are age dependent and might reflect different aging processes, such as incomplete mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. The use of metabolomics will increase our understanding of aging networks and may lead to discoveries that help enhance healthy aging.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: There is debate over the most appropriate adiposity markers of obesity-associated health risks. We evaluated the relationship between fat distribution and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), independent of total adiposity. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied 350 people with abdominal adiposity (waist-to-hip ratio [WHR] {\textgreater} or =0.9 in male and {\textgreater} or =0.85 in female subjects) and 199 control subjects (WHR {\textless}0.9 in male and {\textless}0.85 in female subjects) matched for BMI and age. We measured hs-CRP and major cardiovascular risk factors. RESULTS: Participants with abdominal adiposity had BMI similar to that in control subjects (24.8 +/- 2.5 vs. 24.7 +/- 2.2 kg/m(2), respectively), but significantly higher waist circumference (96.4 +/- 6.0 vs. 83.3 +/- 6.7 cm; P {\textless} 0.01) and WHR (1.07 +/- 0.08 vs. 0.85 +/- 0.05; P {\textless} 0.001). Compared with the control subjects, participants with abdominal adiposity had an adverse cardiovascular risk factor profile, significantly higher hs-CRP (1.96 +/- 2.60 vs. 1.53 +/- 1.74 mg/dl; P {\textless} 0.01), and a twofold prevalence of elevated CRP values ({\textgreater}3 mg/dl). CONCLUSIONS: In nonobese people, moderate abdominal adiposity is associated with markers of subclinical inflammation independent of BMI.},

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE databases through August 2015. We conducted a qualitative review of cross-sectional and prospective studies. Additionally, meta-analyses of metabolite markers, with data estimates from at least three prospective studies, and type 2 diabetes risk were conducted, and multivariable-adjusted relative risks of type 2 diabetes were calculated per study-specific SD difference in a given metabolite. RESULTS: We identified 27 cross-sectional and 19 prospective publications reporting associations of metabolites and prediabetes and/or type 2 diabetes. Carbohydrate (glucose and fructose), lipid (phospholipids, sphingomyelins, and triglycerides), and amino acid (branched-chain amino acids, aromatic amino acids, glycine, and glutamine) metabolites were higher in individuals with type 2 diabetes compared with control subjects. Prospective studies provided evidence that blood concentrations of several metabolites, including hexoses, branched-chain amino acids, aromatic amino acids, phospholipids, and triglycerides, were associated with the incidence of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes. We meta-analyzed results from eight prospective studies that reported risk estimates for metabolites and type 2 diabetes, including 8,000 individuals of whom 1,940 had type 2 diabetes. We found 36{\%} higher risk of type 2 diabetes per study-specific SD difference for isoleucine (pooled relative risk 1.36 [1.24-1.48]; I(2) = 9.5{\%}), 36{\%} for leucine (1.36 [1.17-1.58]; I(2) = 37.4{\%}), 35{\%} for valine (1.35 [1.19-1.53]; I(2) = 45.8{\%}), 36{\%} for tyrosine (1.36 [1.19-1.55]; I(2) = 51.6{\%}), and 26{\%} for phenylalanine (1.26 [1.10-1.44]; I(2) = 56{\%}). Glycine and glutamine were inversely associated with type 2 diabetes risk (0.89 [0.81-0.96] and 0.85 [0.82-0.89], respectively; both I(2) = 0.0{\%}). CONCLUSIONS: In studies using high-throughput metabolomics, several blood amino acids appear to be consistently associated with the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.},

abstract = {BMI is correlated with circulating metabolites, but few studies discuss other adiposity measures, and little is known about metabolomic correlates of BMI from early life. We investigated associations between different adiposity measures, BMI from childhood through adulthood, and metabolites quantified from serum using (1)H NMR spectroscopy in 900 British men and women aged 60-64. We assessed BMI, waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), android-to-gynoid fat ratio (AGR), and BMI from childhood through adulthood. Linear regression with Bonferroni adjustment was performed to assess adiposity and metabolites. Of 233 metabolites, 168; 126; and 133 were associated with BMI, WHR, and AGR at age 60-64, respectively. Associations were strongest for HDL, particularly HDL particle size-e.g., there was 0.08 SD decrease in HDL diameter (95{\%} CI: 0.07-0.10) with each unit increase in BMI. BMI-adjusted AGR or WHR were associated with 31 metabolites where there was no metabolome-wide association with BMI. We identified inverse associations between BMI at age 7 and glucose or glycoprotein at age 60-64 and relatively large LDL cholesteryl ester with postadolescent BMI gains. In summary, we identified metabolomic correlates of central adiposity and earlier-life BMI. These findings support opportunities to leverage metabolomics in early prevention of cardiovascular risk attributable to body fatness.},

Physiol Rev 84: 277?359, 2004; 10.1152/physrev.00015.2003.?The function of brown adipose tissue is to transfer energy from food into heat; physiologically, both the heat produced and the resulting decrease in metabolic efficiency can be of significance. Both the acute activity of the tissue, i.e., the heat production, and the recruitment process in the tissue (that results in a higher thermogenic capacity) are under the control of norepinephrine released from sympathetic nerves. In thermoregulatory thermogenesis, brown adipose tissue is essential for classical nonshivering thermogen-esis (this phenomenon does not exist in the absence of functional brown adipose tissue), as well as for the cold acclimation-recruited norepinephrine-induced thermogenesis. Heat production from brown adipose tissue is activated whenever the organism is in need of extra heat, e.g., postnatally, during entry into a febrile state, and during arousal from hibernation, and the rate of thermogenesis is centrally controlled via a pathway initiated in the hypothalamus. Feeding as such also results in activation of brown adipose tissue; a series of diets, apparently all characterized by being low in protein, result in a leptin-dependent recruitment of the tissue; this metaboloregulatory thermogenesis is also under hypothalamic control. When the tissue is active, high amounts of lipids and glucose are combusted in the tissue. The development of brown adipose tissue with its characteristic protein, uncoupling protein-1 (UCP1), was probably determinative for the evolutionary success of mammals, as its thermogenesis enhances neonatal survival and allows for active life even in cold surroundings.},

abstract = {In observational studies, abdominal adiposity has been associated with type 2 diabetes and coronary heart disease (CHD). Whether these associations represent causal relationships remains uncertain.To test the association of a polygenic risk score for waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) adjusted for body mass index (BMI), a measure of abdominal adiposity, with type 2 diabetes and CHD through the potential intermediates of blood lipids, blood pressure, and glycemic phenotypes.A polygenic risk score for WHR adjusted for BMI, a measure of genetic predisposition to abdominal adiposity, was constructed with 48 single-nucleotide polymorphisms. The association of this score with cardiometabolic traits, type 2 diabetes, and CHD was tested in a mendelian randomization analysis that combined case-control and cross-sectional data sets. Estimates for cardiometabolic traits were based on a combined data set consisting of summary results from 4 genome-wide association studies conducted from 2007 to 2015, including up to 322 154 participants, as well as individual-level, cross-sectional data from the UK Biobank collected from 2007-2011, including 111 986 individuals. Estimates for type 2 diabetes and CHD were derived from summary statistics of 2 separate genome-wide association studies conducted from 2007 to 2015 and including 149 821 individuals and 184 305 individuals, respectively, combined with individual-level data from the UK Biobank.Genetic predisposition to increased WHR adjusted for BMI.Type 2 diabetes and CHD.Among 111 986 individuals in the UK Biobank, the mean age was 57 (SD, 8) years, 58 845 participants (52.5{\%}) were women, and mean WHR was 0.875. Analysis of summary-level genome-wide association study results and individual-level UK Biobank data demonstrated that a 1-SD increase in WHR adjusted for BMI mediated by the polygenic risk score was associated with 27-mg/dL higher triglyceride levels, 4.1-mg/dL higher 2-hour glucose levels, and 2.1–mm Hg higher systolic blood pressure (each P {\textless} .001). A 1-SD genetic increase in WHR adjusted for BMI was also associated with a higher risk of type 2 diabetes (odds ratio, 1.77 [95{\%} CI, 1.57-2.00]; absolute risk increase per 1000 participant-years, 6.0 [95{\%} CI, CI, 4.4-7.8]; number of participants with type 2 diabetes outcome, 40 530) and CHD (odds ratio, 1.46 [95{\%} CI, 1.32-1.62]; absolute risk increase per 1000 participant-years, 1.8 [95{\%} CI, 1.3-2.4]; number of participants with CHD outcome, 66 440).A genetic predisposition to higher waist-to-hip ratio adjusted for body mass index was associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes and coronary heart disease. These results provide evidence supportive of a causal association between abdominal adiposity and these outcomes.},

Excess body fat deposition is a risk factor for many types of cancer. Men and women exhibit differences in body fat distribution and energy homeostasis regulation. This systematic review aimed to understand why sex disparities in obesity are associated with sex differences in the incidence of gastrointestinal cancers. Cancers of the esophagus, liver, and colon are representative gastrointestinal cancers, and obesity is a convincing risk factor for their development. Numerous epidemiological studies have found sex differences in the incidence of esophageal, liver, and colorectal cancers. We suggest that these sexual disparities are partly explained by the availability of estrogens and other genetic factors regulating inflammation, cell growth, and apoptosis. Sex differences in gut microbiota composition may contribute to differences in the incidence and phenotype of colorectal cancer. To establish successful practices in personalized nutrition and medicine, one should be aware of the sex differences in the pathophysiology and associated mechanisms of cancer development.},

abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Estimates of the relative mortality risks associated with normal weight, overweight, and obesity may help to inform decision making in the clinical setting. OBJECTIVE: To perform a systematic review of reported hazard ratios (HRs) of all-cause mortality for overweight and obesity relative to normal weight in the general population. DATA SOURCES: PubMed and EMBASE electronic databases were searched through September 30, 2012, without language restrictions. STUDY SELECTION: Articles that reported HRs for all-cause mortality using standard body mass index (BMI) categories from prospective studies of general populations of adults were selected by consensus among multiple reviewers. Studies were excluded that used nonstandard categories or that were limited to adolescents or to those with specific medical conditions or to those undergoing specific procedures. PubMed searches yielded 7034 articles, of which 141 (2.0{\%}) were eligible. An EMBASE search yielded 2 additional articles. After eliminating overlap, 97 studies were retained for analysis, providing a combined sample size of more than 2.88 million individuals and more than 270,000 deaths. DATA EXTRACTION: Data were extracted by 1 reviewer and then reviewed by 3 independent reviewers. We selected the most complex model available for the full sample and used a variety of sensitivity analyses to address issues of possible overadjustment (adjusted for factors in causal pathway) or underadjustment (not adjusted for at least age, sex, and smoking). RESULTS: Random-effects summary all-cause mortality HRs for overweight (BMI of 25-{\textless}30), obesity (BMI of ≥30), grade 1 obesity (BMI of 30-{\textless}35), and grades 2 and 3 obesity (BMI of ≥35) were calculated relative to normal weight (BMI of 18.5-{\textless}25). The summary HRs were 0.94 (95{\%} CI, 0.91-0.96) for overweight, 1.18 (95{\%} CI, 1.12-1.25) for obesity (all grades combined), 0.95 (95{\%} CI, 0.88-1.01) for grade 1 obesity, and 1.29 (95{\%} CI, 1.18-1.41) for grades 2 and 3 obesity. These findings persisted when limited to studies with measured weight and height that were considered to be adequately adjusted. The HRs tended to be higher when weight and height were self-reported rather than measured. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Relative to normal weight, both obesity (all grades) and grades 2 and 3 obesity were associated with significantly higher all-cause mortality. Grade 1 obesity overall was not associated with higher mortality, and overweight was associated with significantly lower all-cause mortality. The use of predefined standard BMI groupings can facilitate between-study comparisons.},

However, obesity's influence on dementia remains poorly understood. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis. PUBMED search (1995-2007) resulted in 10 relevant prospective cohort studies of older adults (40-80 years at baseline) with end points being dementia and predictors including adiposity measures, such as body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC). There was a significant U-shaped association between BMI and dementia (P = 0.034), with dementia risk increased for obesity and underweight. Pooled odds ratios (OR) and 95{\%} confidence intervals (CI) for underweight, overweight and obesity compared with normal weight in relation to incident dementia were: 1.36 (1.07, 1.73), 0.88 (0.60, 1.27) and 1.42 (0.93, 2.18) respectively. Pooled ORs and 95{\%} CI for obesity and incident Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia were 1.80 (1.00, 3.29) vs. 1.73 (0.47, 6.31) and were stronger in studies with long follow-up ({\textgreater}10 years) and young baseline age ({\textless}60 years).

Our classes help differentiate adiposity genetics with respect to anthropometry, fat depots, and metabolic health.

Class-specific enrichment analyses implicate digestive systems as a pathway in adiposity genetics. Our results demonstrate that WHRadjBMI variants capture relevant effects of "unexpected fat distribution given the BMI" and that a joint view of the genetics underlying related phenotypes can inform on important biology.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: Liver disease is traditionally categorized as alcoholic and non-alcoholic. We studied various risk factors predictive of advanced non-viral liver disease in general population and analyzed the interaction between these factors and alcohol consumption. METHODS: Persons without underlying liver disease who participated in the Health2000 or FINRISK studies 1992-2012 comprised a cohort of 41 260 individuals. Pattern of alcohol consumption and metabolic, lifestyle-related, and anthropometric parameters were analyzed with Cox regression analysis using severe liver disease hospitalization, cancer, or death as end-point. Viral liver diseases were excluded. RESULTS: A total of 355 liver events occurred during the mean 12.4-year follow-up (511 789 person-years). In the multivariate model, age (hazard ratio [HR] 1.03, P = 0.0083 for men; HR 1.04, P = 0.0198 for women), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) (HR 1.52, P = 0.0006 for men; HR 1.58, P = 0.0167 for women), patatin-like phospholipase-containing domain 3 mutations (HR 1.9, P = 0.024 for men; HR 2.7, P = 0.0109 for women), and weekly binge drinking (HR 2.4, P = 0.0024 for men; HR 7.4, P {\textless} 0.0001 for women) predicted development of severe liver disease. Among men, diabetes (HR 2.7, P = 0.0002), average alcohol consumption (HR for 10 g/day 1.1, P = 0.0022), non-married status (HR 1.9, P = 0.0397 for single; HR 2.4, P = 0.0002 for widowed/separated), and serum high-density lipoprotein (HR 2.2, P = 0.0022) and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HR 1.2, P = 0.0237) were additional risk factors. Alcohol intake increased the risk especially among persons with high WHR (P for interaction 0.009). CONCLUSIONS: Age, patatin-like phospholipase-containing domain 3 haplotype, and WHR increase the risk for development of severe liver disease. We found strong synergism between alcohol and central obesity. Binge drinking is an additional risk factor.},

abstract = {IMPORTANCE: African American men have the highest rates of prostate cancer incidence and mortality in the United States. Understanding underlying reasons for this disparity could identify preventive interventions important to African American men. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the association of obesity with prostate cancer risk differs between African American and non-Hispanic white men and whether obesity modifies the excess risk associated with African American race. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Prospective study of 3398 African American and 22,673 non-Hispanic white men who participated in the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (2001-2011) with present analyses completed in 2014. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Total, low-grade (Gleason score {\textless}7), and high-grade (Gleason score ≥7) prostate cancer incidence. RESULTS: With a median (interquartile range) follow-up of 5.6 (1.8) years, there were 270, 148, and 88 cases of total, low-, and high-grade prostate cancers among African American men and a corresponding 1453, 898, and 441 cases in non-Hispanic white men, respectively. Although not associated with risk among non-Hispanic white men, BMI was positively associated with an increase in risk among African American men (BMI, {\textless}25 vs ≥35: hazard ratio [HR], 1.49 [95{\%} CI, 0.95, 2.34]; P for trend = .03). Consequently, the risk associated with African American race increased from 28{\%} (HR, 1.28 [95{\%} CI, 0.91-1.80]) among men with BMI less than 25 to 103{\%} (HR, 2.03 [95{\%} CI, 1.38-2.98]) among African American men with BMI at least 35 (P for trend = .03). Body mass index was inversely associated with low-grade prostate cancer risk within non-Hispanic white men (BMI, {\textless}25 vs ≥35: HR, 0.80 [95{\%} CI, 0.58-1.09]; P for trend = .02) but positively associated with risk within African American men (BMI, {\textless}25 vs ≥35: HR, 2.22 [95{\%} CI, 1.17-4.21]; P for trend = .05). Body mass index was positively associated with risk of high-grade prostate cancer in both non-Hispanic white men (BMI, {\textless}25 vs ≥35: HR, 1.33 [95{\%} CI, 0.90-1.97]; P for trend = .01) and African American men, although the increase may be larger within African American men, albeit the racial interaction was not statistically significant (BMI, {\textless}25 vs ≥35: HR, 1.81 [95{\%} CI, 0.79-4.11]; P for trend = .02). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Obesity is more strongly associated with increased prostate cancer risk among African American than non-Hispanic white men and reducing obesity among African American men could reduce the racial disparity in cancer incidence. Additional research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the differential effects of obesity in African American and non-Hispanic white men.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Numerous risk factors for dementia are well established, though the causal nature of these associations remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: To systematically review Mendelian randomization (MR) studies investigating causal relationships between risk factors and global cognitive function or dementia. METHODS: We searched five databases from inception to February 2017 and conducted citation searches including MR studies investigating the association between any risk factor and global cognitive function, all-cause dementia or dementia subtypes. Two reviewers independently assessed titles and abstracts, full-texts, and study quality. RESULTS: We included 18 MR studies investigating education, lifestyle factors, cardiovascular factors and related biomarkers, diabetes related and other endocrine factors, and telomere length. Studies were of predominantly good quality, however eight received low ratings for sample size and statistical power. The most convincing causal evidence was found for an association of shorter telomeres with increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Causal evidence was weaker for smoking quantity, vitamin D, homocysteine, systolic blood pressure, fasting glucose, insulin sensitivity, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Well-replicated associations were not present for most exposures and we cannot fully discount survival and diagnostic bias, or the potential for pleiotropic effects. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic evidence supported a causal association between telomere length and AD, whereas limited evidence for other risk factors was largely inconclusive with tentative evidence for smoking quantity, vitamin D, homocysteine, and selected metabolic markers. The lack of stronger evidence for other risk factors may reflect insufficient statistical power. Larger well-designed MR studies would therefore help establish the causal status of these dementia risk factors.},

abstract = {Hypertension is a chronic health condition in which blood pressure is usually elevated beyond normal levels. It can progress with serious complications if left undetected and untreated. Incidence of hypertension is on the increase worldwide with debilitating consequences on the health systems of many countries. It is a multifactorial disorder that requires a multi-pronged approach to address it. One such approach is the use of metabolomics or metabolite profiling to understand its underlying cause and possibly control it. Changes in metabolites profiles have been used to accurately predict so many disease conditions in addition to identifying possible biomarkers and pathways associated in their pathogenicity. This will enable their early detection, diagnosis and treatment as well as likely complications that may arise and also assist in development of biomarkers for clinical uses. The objective of this review therefore is to present some of the current knowledge on the application of metabolomics profiling in hypertension and blood pressure control.},

abstract = {Adipose tissue morphology and release of free fatty acids, as well as peptide hormones, are believed to contribute to obesity and related metabolic disorders. These adipose tissue phenotypes are influenced by adiposity, but there is also a strong hereditary impact. Polymorphisms in numerous adipose-expressed genes have been evaluated for association with adipocyte and clinical phenotypes. In our opinion, some results are convincing. Thus ADRB2 and GPR74 genes are associated with adipocyte lipolysis, GPR74 also with BMI; PPARG and SREBP1, which promote adipogenesis and lipid storage, are associated with T2D and possible adiposity; ADIPOQ and ARL15 are associated with circulating levels of adiponectin, ARL15 also with coronary heart disease. We anticipate that the use of complementary approaches such as expression profiling and RNAi screening, and studies of additional levels of gene regulation, that is, miRNA and epigenetics, will be important to unravel the genetics of adipose tissue function.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Metabolomics identifies phenotypical groups with specific metabolic profiles, being increasingly applied to several pregnancy conditions. This is the first preliminary study analyzing placental metabolomics in normal weight (NW) and obese (OB) pregnancies. METHODS: Twenty NW (18.5 ≤ BMI{\textless} 25 kg/m(2)) and eighteen OB (BMI≥ 30 kg/m(2)) pregnancies were studied. Placental biopsies were collected at elective caesarean section. Metabolites extraction method was optimized for hydrophilic and lipophilic phases, then analyzed with GC-MS. Univariate and PLS-DA multivariate analysis were applied. RESULTS: Univariate analysis showed increased uracil levels while multivariate PLS-DA analysis revealed lower levels of LC-PUFA derivatives in the lipophilic phase and several metabolites with significantly different levels in the hydrophilic phase of OB vs NW. DISCUSSION: Placental metabolome analysis of obese pregnancies showed differences in metabolites involved in antioxidant defenses, nucleotide production, as well as lipid synthesis and energy production, supporting a shift towards higher placental metabolism. OB placentas also showed a specific fatty acids profile suggesting a disruption of LC-PUFA biomagnification. This study can lay the foundation to further metabolomic placental characterization in maternal obesity. Metabolic signatures in obese placentas may reflect changes occurring in the intrauterine metabolic environment, which may affect the development of adult diseases.},

We explored the prospective role of metabolic risk in eating disorders in a UK cohort (n = 2929 participants), measuring 158 metabolic traits in non-fasting EDTA-plasma by nuclear magnetic resonance. We associated metabolic markers at 7 years (exposure) with risk for anorexia nervosa and binge-eating disorder (outcomes) at 14, 16, and 18 years using logistic regression adjusted for maternal education, child's sex, age, body mass index, and calorie intake at 7 years. Elevated very low-density lipoproteins, triglycerides, apolipoprotein-B/A, and monounsaturated fatty acids ratio were associated with lower odds of anorexia nervosa at age 18, while elevated high-density lipoproteins, docosahexaenoic acid and polyunsaturated fatty acids ratio, and fatty acid unsaturation were associated with higher risk for anorexia nervosa at 18 years. Elevated linoleic acid and n-6 fatty acid ratios were associated with lower odds of binge-eating disorder at 16 years, while elevated saturated fatty acid ratio was associated with higher odds of binge-eating disorder. Most associations had large confidence intervals and showed, for anorexia nervosa, different directions across time points. Overall, our results show some evidence for a role of metabolic factors in eating disorders development in adolescence.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mendelian randomization uses genetic variants, assumed to be instrumental variables for a particular exposure, to estimate the causal effect of that exposure on an outcome. If the instrumental variable criteria are satisfied, the resulting estimator is consistent even in the presence of unmeasured confounding and reverse causation. METHODS: We extend the Mendelian randomization paradigm to investigate more complex networks of relationships between variables, in particular where some of the effect of an exposure on the outcome may operate through an intermediate variable (a mediator). If instrumental variables for the exposure and mediator are available, direct and indirect effects of the exposure on the outcome can be estimated, for example using either a regression-based method or structural equation models. The direction of effect between the exposure and a possible mediator can also be assessed. Methods are illustrated in an applied example considering causal relationships between body mass index, C-reactive protein and uric acid. RESULTS: These estimators are consistent in the presence of unmeasured confounding if, in addition to the instrumental variable assumptions, the effects of both the exposure on the mediator and the mediator on the outcome are homogeneous across individuals and linear without interactions. Nevertheless, a simulation study demonstrates that even considerable heterogeneity in these effects does not lead to bias in the estimates. CONCLUSIONS: These methods can be used to estimate direct and indirect causal effects in a mediation setting, and have potential for the investigation of more complex networks between multiple interrelated exposures and disease outcomes.},

abstract = {Background: Metabolic syndrome and its component feature, central obesity, are associated with endometrial cancer risk. It remains unclear whether associations with the other metabolic factors that comprise metabolic syndrome are independent of the obesity–endometrial cancer association. Furthermore, the link with specific endometrial cancer subtypes remains ill-defined, despite evidence of etiologic heterogeneity among these tumors. Methods: In a case–control study within the SEER–Medicare linked database, we examined whether metabolic factors, individually or combined, were associated with endometrial cancer. Cases (n = 16,323) were women diagnosed with endometrial cancer from 1993 through 2007. Controls (n = 100,751) were a 5{\%} sample of female Medicare enrollees residing in the same SEER registry area as cases. Metabolic syndrome was defined using ICD-9-CM codes from inpatient/outpatient diagnoses 1 to 3 years before case diagnosis and a comparable time period in controls. ORs and 95{\%} confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using logistic regression. Results: Endometrial cancer risk was associated with metabolic syndrome [OR (95{\%} CI): 1.39 (1.32–1.47)] and its component factors: overweight/obesity [1.95 (1.80–2.11)], impaired fasting glucose [1.36 (1.30–1.43)], high blood pressure [1.31 (1.25–1.36)], and high triglycerides [1.13 (1.08–1.18)]. After adjusting for overweight/obesity, the increased risks associated with the metabolic syndrome factors remained. Heterogeneity of associations by subtype were not identified (Pheterogeneity = 0.82). Conclusions: Among women age 65 and older in the United States, metabolic syndrome, and its component factors, increased endometrial cancer risk similarly across endometrial cancer subtypes. Impact: Strategies to reduce the prevalence of metabolic syndrome factors might have a favorable effect on endometrial cancer incidence.

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To review progress in understanding the methods and results concerning the causal contribution of body mass index (BMI) to health and disease. METHODS: In the context of conventional evidence focused on the relationship between BMI and health, this review considers current literature on the common, population-based, genetic contribution to BMI and how this has fed into the developing field of applied epidemiology. RESULTS: Technological and analytical developments have driven considerable success in identifying genetic variants relevant to BMI. This has enabled the implementation of Mendelian randomization to address questions of causality. The product of this work has been the implication of BMI as a causal agent in a host of health outcomes. Further breakdown of causal pathways by integration with other "omics" technologies promises to deliver additional benefit. CONCLUSIONS: Gaps remain in our understanding of BMI as a risk factor for health and disease, and while promising, applied genetic epidemiology should be considered alongside alternative methods for assessing the impact of BMI on health. Potential limitations, relating to inappropriate or nonspecific measures of obesity and the improper use of genetic instruments, will need to be explored and incorporated into future research aiming to dissect BMI as a risk factor.},

abstract = {Studies combined in a meta-analysis often have differences in their design and conduct that can lead to heterogeneous results. A random-effects model accounts for these differences in the underlying study effects, which includes a heterogeneity variance parameter. The DerSimonian-Laird method is often used to estimate the heterogeneity variance, but simulation studies have found the method can be biased and other methods are available. This paper compares the properties of nine different heterogeneity variance estimators using simulated meta-analysis data. Simulated scenarios include studies of equal size and of moderate and large differences in size. Results confirm that the DerSimonian-Laird estimator is negatively biased in scenarios with small studies and in scenarios with a rare binary outcome. Results also show the Paule-Mandel method has considerable positive bias in meta-analyses with large differences in study size. We recommend the method of restricted maximum likelihood (REML) to estimate the heterogeneity variance over other methods. However, considering that meta-analyses of health studies typically contain few studies, the heterogeneity variance estimate should not be used as a reliable gauge for the extent of heterogeneity in a meta-analysis. The estimated summary effect of the meta-analysis and its confidence interval derived from the Hartung-Knapp-Sidik-Jonkman method are more robust to changes in the heterogeneity variance estimate and show minimal deviation from the nominal coverage of 95{\%} under most of our simulated scenarios.},

abstract = {Comprehensive characterization of human tissues promises novel insights into the biological architecture of human diseases and traits. We assessed metabonomic, transcriptomic, and genomic variation for a large population-based cohort from the capital region of Finland. Network analyses identified a set of highly correlated genes, the lipid-leukocyte (LL) module, as having a prominent role in over 80 serum metabolites (of 134 measures quantified), including lipoprotein subclasses, lipids, and amino acids. Concurrent association with immune response markers suggested the LL module as a possible link between inflammation, metabolism, and adiposity. Further, genomic variation was used to generate a directed network and infer LL module's largely reactive nature to metabolites. Finally, gene co-expression in circulating leukocytes was shown to be dependent on serum metabolite concentrations, providing evidence for the hypothesis that the coherence of molecular networks themselves is conditional on environmental factors. These findings show the importance and opportunity of systematic molecular investigation of human population samples. To facilitate and encourage this investigation, the metabonomic, transcriptomic, and genomic data used in this study have been made available as a resource for the research community. {\textcopyright} 2010 EMBO and Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.},

@article{Biro2010,
abstract = {The prevalence and severity of obesity have increased in recent years, likely the result of complex interactions between genes, dietary intake, physical activity, and the environment. The expression of genes favoring the storage of excess calories as fat, which have been selected for over many millennia and are relatively static, has become maladaptive in a rapidly changing environment that minimizes opportunities for energy expenditure and maximizes opportunities for energy intake. The consequences of childhood and adolescent obesity include earlier puberty and menarche in girls, type 2 diabetes and increased incidence of the metabolic syndrome in youth and adults, and obesity in adulthood. These changes are associated with cardiovascular disease as well as with several cancers in adults, likely through insulin resistance and production of inflammatory cytokines. Although concerns have arisen regarding environmental exposures, there have been no formal expert recommendations. Currently, the most important factors underlying the obesity epidemic are the current opportunities for energy intake coupled with limited energy expenditure.},

abstract = {Background: Although interest in the relationship between obesity and kidney disease is increasing, few epidemiologic studies have examined whether excess weight is an independent risk factor for end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Objective: To determine the association between increased body mass index (BMI) and risk for ESRD. Design: Historical (nonconcurrent) cohort study. Setting: A large integrated health care delivery system in northern California. Participants: 320?252 adult members of Kaiser Permanente who volunteered for screening health checkups between 1964 and 1985 and who had height and weight measured. Measurements: The authors ascertained ESRD cases by matching data with the U.S. Renal Data System registry through 2000. Results: A total of 1471 cases of ESRD occurred during 8?347?955 person-years of follow-up. Higher BMI was a risk factor for ESRD in multivariable models that adjusted for age, sex, race, education level, smoking status, history of myocardial infarction, serum cholesterol level, urinalysis proteinuria, urinalysis hematuria, and serum creatinine level. Compared with persons who had normal weight (BMI, 18.5 to 24.9 kg/m2), the adjusted relative risk for ESRD was 1.87 (95{\%} CI, 1.64 to 2.14) for those who were overweight (BMI, 25.0 to 29.9 kg/m2), 3.57 (CI, 3.05 to 4.18) for those with class I obesity (BMI, 30.0 to 34.9 kg/m2), 6.12 (CI, 4.97 to 7.54) for those with class II obesity (BMI, 35.0 to 39.9 kg/m2), and 7.07 (CI, 5.37 to 9.31) for those with extreme obesity (BMI ≥ 40 kg/m2). Higher baseline BMI remained an independent predictor for ESRD after additional adjustments for baseline blood pressure level and presence or absence of diabetes mellitus. Limitations: Primary analyses were based on single measurements of exposures. Conclusions: High BMI is a common, strong, and potentially modifiable risk factor for ESRD.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Body-mass index (BMI) and diabetes have increased worldwide, whereas  global average blood pressure and cholesterol have decreased or remained unchanged in the past three decades. We quantified how much of the effects of BMI on coronary heart disease and stroke are mediated through blood pressure, cholesterol, and glucose, and how much is independent of these factors. METHODS: We pooled data from 97 prospective cohort studies that collectively enrolled 1{\textperiodcentered}8 million participants between 1948 and 2005, and that included 57,161 coronary heart disease and 31,093 stroke events. For each cohort we excluded participants who were younger than 18 years, had a BMI of lower than 20 kg/m(2), or who had a history of coronary heart disease or stroke. We estimated the hazard ratio (HR) of BMI on coronary heart disease and stroke with and without adjustment for all possible combinations of blood pressure, cholesterol, and glucose. We pooled HRs with a random-effects model and calculated the attenuation of excess risk after adjustment for mediators. FINDINGS: The HR for each 5 kg/m(2) higher BMI was 1{\textperiodcentered}27 (95{\%} CI 1{\textperiodcentered}23-1{\textperiodcentered}31) for coronary heart disease and 1{\textperiodcentered}18 (1{\textperiodcentered}14-1{\textperiodcentered}22) for stroke after adjustment for confounders. Additional adjustment for the three metabolic risk factors reduced the HRs to 1{\textperiodcentered}15 (1{\textperiodcentered}12-1{\textperiodcentered}18) for coronary heart disease and 1{\textperiodcentered}04 (1{\textperiodcentered}01-1{\textperiodcentered}08) for stroke, suggesting that 46{\%} (95{\%} CI 42-50) of the excess risk of BMI for coronary heart disease and 76{\%} (65-91) for stroke is mediated by these factors. Blood pressure was the most important mediator, accounting for 31{\%} (28-35) of the excess risk for coronary heart disease and 65{\%} (56-75) for stroke. The percentage excess risks mediated by these three mediators did not differ significantly between Asian and western cohorts (North America, western Europe, Australia, and New Zealand). Both overweight (BMI ≥25 to {\textless}30 kg/m(2)) and obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m(2)) were associated with a significantly increased risk of coronary heart disease and stroke, compared with normal weight (BMI ≥20 to {\textless}25 kg/m(2)), with 50{\%} (44-58) of the excess risk of overweight and 44{\%} (41-48) of the excess risk of obesity for coronary heart disease mediated by the selected three mediators. The percentages for stroke were 98{\%} (69-155) for overweight and 69{\%} (64-77) for obesity. INTERPRETATION: Interventions that reduce high blood pressure, cholesterol, and glucose might address about half of excess risk of coronary heart disease and three-quarters of excess risk of stroke associated with high BMI. Maintenance of optimum bodyweight is needed for the full benefits.

abstract = {BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Metabolites in blood have been found associated with the  occurrence of vascular diseases, but its role in the functional recovery of stroke is unclear. The aim of this study is to investigate whether the untargeted metabolomics at the acute stage of ischemic stroke is able to predict functional recovery. METHODS: One hundred and fifty patients with acute ischemic stroke were recruited and followed up for 3 months. Fasting blood samples within 7 days of stroke were obtained, liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry were applied to identify outcome-associated metabolites. The patients' clinical characteristics and identified metabolites were included for constructing the outcome prediction model using machine learning approaches. RESULTS: By using multivariate analysis, 220 differentially expressed metabolites (DEMs) were discovered between patients with favorable outcomes (modified Rankin Scale, mRS ≤ 2 at 3 months, n = 77) and unfavorable outcomes (mRS ≥ 3 at 3 months, n = 73). After feature selection, 63 DEMs were chosen for constructing the outcome prediction model. The predictive accuracy was below 0.65 when including patients' clinical characteristics, and could reach 0.80 when including patients' clinical characteristics and 63 selected DEMs. The functional enrichment analysis identified platelet activating factor (PAF) as the strongest outcome-associated metabolite, which involved in proinflammatory mediators release, arachidonic acid metabolism, eosinophil degranulation, and production of reactive oxygen species. CONCLUSION: Metabolomics is a potential method to explore the blood biomarkers of acute ischemic stroke. The patients with unfavorable outcomes had a lower PAF level compared to those with favorable outcomes.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Observational studies have reported a positive association between body mass index (BMI) and ovarian cancer risk. However, questions remain as to whether this represents a causal effect, or holds for all histological subtypes. The lack of association observed for serous cancers may, for instance, be due to disease-associated weight loss. Mendelian randomization (MR) uses genetic markers as proxies for risk factors to overcome limitations of observational studies. We used MR to elucidate the relationship between BMI and ovarian cancer, hypothesizing that genetically predicted BMI would be associated with increased risk of non-high grade serous ovarian cancers (non-HGSC) but not HGSC. METHODS: We pooled data from 39 studies (14 047 cases, 23 003 controls) in the Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium. We constructed a weighted genetic risk score (GRS, partial F-statistic = 172), summing alleles at 87 single nucleotide polymorphisms previously associated with BMI, weighting by their published strength of association with BMI. Applying two-stage predictor-substitution MR, we used logistic regression to estimate study-specific odds ratios (OR) and 95{\%} confidence intervals (CI) for the association between genetically predicted BMI and risk, and pooled these using random-effects meta-analysis. RESULTS: Higher genetically predicted BMI was associated with increased risk of non-HGSC (pooled OR = 1.29, 95{\%} CI 1.03-1.61 per 5 units BMI) but not HGSC (pooled OR = 1.06, 95{\%} CI 0.88-1.27). Secondary analyses stratified by behaviour/subtype suggested that, consistent with observational data, the association was strongest for low-grade/borderline serous cancers (OR = 1.93, 95{\%} CI 1.33-2.81). CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that higher BMI increases risk of non-HGSC, but not the more common and aggressive HGSC subtype, confirming the observational evidence.},

abstract = {The development of depression may involve a complex interplay of environmental and genetic risk factors. PubMed and PsycInfo databases were searched from inception through August 3, 2017, to identify meta-analyses and Mendelian randomization (MR) studies of environmental risk factors associated with depression. For each eligible meta-analysis, we estimated the summary effect size and its 95{\%} confidence interval (CI) by random-effects modeling, the 95{\%} prediction interval, heterogeneity with I2, and evidence of small-study effects and excess significance bias. Seventy meta-analytic reviews met the eligibility criteria and provided 134 meta-analyses for associations from 1283 primary studies. While 109 associations were nominally significant (P {\textless} 0.05), only 8 met the criteria for convincing evidence and, when limited to prospective studies, convincing evidence was found in 6 (widowhood, physical abuse during childhood, obesity, having 4–5 metabolic risk factors, sexual dysfunction, job strain). In studies in which depression was assessed through a structured diagnostic interview, only associations with widowhood, job strain, and being a Gulf War veteran were supported by convincing evidence. Additionally, 8 MR studies were included and provided no consistent evidence for the causal effects of obesity, smoking, and alcohol consumption. The proportion of variance explained by genetic risk factors was extremely small (0.1–0.4{\%}), which limited the evidence provided by the MR studies. Our findings suggest that despite the large number of putative risk factors investigated in the literature, few associations were supported by robust evidence. The current findings may have clinical and research implications for the early identification of individuals at risk for depression.},

Mendelian randomization studies of unrelated individuals may be susceptible to bias from family structure, for example, through dynastic effects which occur when parental genotypes directly affect offspring phenotypes. Here we describe methods for within-family Mendelian randomization and through simulations show that family-based methods can overcome bias due to dynastic effects. We illustrate these issues empirically using data from 61,008 siblings from the UK Biobank and Nord-Tr{\o}ndelag Health Study. Both within-family and population-based Mendelian randomization analyses reproduced established effects of lower BMI reducing risk of diabetes and high blood pressure. However, while MR estimates from population-based samples of unrelated individuals suggested that taller height and lower BMI increase educational attainment, these effects largely disappeared in within-family MR analyses. We found differences between population-based and within-family based estimates, indicating the importance of controlling for family effects and population structure in Mendelian randomization studies.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Although obesity is recognized as an important risk of mortality, how the amount and distribution of body fat affect mortality risk is unclear. Furthermore, whether fat distribution confers any additional risk of mortality in addition to fat amount is not understood. METHODS: This data linkage cohort study included 16415 participants (8554 females) aged 18 to 89 years from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III (1988-1994) and its linked mortality data (31 December 2011). Cox proportional hazard models and parametric survival models were used to estimate the association between body fat percentage (BF{\%}), based on bioelectrical impedance analysis, and waist-hip ratio (WHR) with mortality. RESULTS: A total of 4999 deaths occurred during 19-year follow-up. A U-shaped association between BF{\%} and mortality was found in both sexes, with the adjusted hazard ratios for other groups between 1.02 (95{\%} confidence interval: 0.89, 1.18) and 2.10 (1.47, 3.01) when BF{\%} groups of 25-30{\%} in males and 30-35{\%} in females were used as references. A non-linear relationship between WHR and mortality was detected in males, with the adjusted hazard ratios among other groups ranging from 1.05 (0.94, 1.18) to 1.52 (1.15, 2.00) compared with the WHR category of 0.95-1.0. However in females, the death risk constantly increased across the WHR spectrum. Joint impact of BF{\%} and WHR suggested males with BF{\%} of 25-30{\%} and WHR of 0.95-1.0 and females with BF{\%} of 30-35{\%} and WHR {\textless}0.9 were associated with the lowest mortality risk and longest survival age compared with their counterparts in other categories. CONCLUSIONS: This study supported the use of body fat distribution in addition to fat amount in assessing the risk of all-cause mortality.},

abstract = {Obesity is a global health problem mainly attributed to lifestyle changes such as diet, low physical activity or socioeconomics factors. However, several evidences consistently showed that genetics contributes significantly to the weight-gain susceptibility.A systematic literature search of most relevant original, review and meta-analysis, restricted to English was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science and Google scholar up to May 2017 concerning the contribution of genetics and environmental factors to obesity.Several evidences suggest that obesogenic environments contribute to the development of an obese phenotype. However, not every individual from the same population, despite sharing the same obesogenic environment, develop obesity.After more than 10 years of investigation on the genetics of obesity, the variants found associated with obesity represent only 3{\%} of the estimated BMI-heritability, which is around 47–80{\%}. Moreover, genetic factors per se were unable to explain the rapid spread of obesity prevalence.The integration of multi-omics data enables scientists having a better picture and to elucidate unknown pathways contributing to obesity.New studies based on case–control or gene candidate approach will be important to identify new variants associated with obesity susceptibility and consequently unveiling its genetic architecture. This will lead to an improvement of our understanding about underlying mechanisms involved in development and origin of the actual obesity epidemic. The integration of several omics will also provide insights about the interplay between genes and environments contributing to the obese phenotype.},

Mediation approaches used in conventional epidemiology have been adapted to understanding the role of molecular intermediates in situations of high-dimensional omics data with varying degrees of success. In particular, the limitations of observational epidemiological study including confounding, reverse causation and measurement error can afflict conventional mediation approaches and may lead to incorrect conclusions regarding causal effects. Solutions to analysing mediation which overcome these problems include the use of instrumental variable methods such as Mendelian randomization, which may be applied to evaluate causality in increasingly complex networks of omics data.},

Among the vast quantity of factors attributed to obesity, environmental, dietary, lifestyle, genetic, and others, the microbiome has aroused curiosity, and the scientific community has published many original articles. Most of the studies related to microbiome and obesity have been reported based on the associations between microbiota and obesity, and the in-depth study of the mechanisms related has been studied mainly in rodents and exceptionally in humans. Due to the quantity and diverse information published, the need of reviews is mandatory to recapitulate the relevant achievements. In this systematic review, we provide an overview of the current evidence on the association between intestinal microbiota and obesity. Additionally, we analyze the effects of an extreme weight loss intervention such as bariatric surgery on gut microbiota. The review is divided into 2 sections: first, the association of obesity and related metabolic disorders with different gut microbiome profiles, including metagenomics studies, and second, changes on gut microbiome after an extreme weight loss intervention such as bariatric surgery.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Synthesis of multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in a systematic review can summarize the effects of individual outcomes and provide numerical answers about the effectiveness of interventions. Filtering of searches is time consuming, and no single method fulfills the principal requirements of speed with accuracy. Automation of systematic reviews is driven by a necessity to expedite the availability of current best evidence for policy and clinical decision-making. We developed Rayyan ( http://rayyan.qcri.org ), a free web and mobile app, that helps expedite the initial screening of abstracts and titles using a process of semi-automation while incorporating a high level of usability. For the beta testing phase, we used two published Cochrane reviews in which included studies had been selected manually. Their searches, with 1030 records and 273 records, were uploaded to Rayyan. Different features of Rayyan were tested using these two reviews. We also conducted a survey of Rayyan's users and collected feedback through a built-in feature. RESULTS: Pilot testing of Rayyan focused on usability, accuracy against manual methods, and the added value of the prediction feature. The "taster" review (273 records) allowed a quick overview of Rayyan for early comments on usability. The second review (1030 records) required several iterations to identify the previously identified 11 trials. The "suggestions" and "hints," based on the "prediction model," appeared as testing progressed beyond five included studies. Post rollout user experiences and a reflexive response by the developers enabled real-time modifications and improvements. The survey respondents reported 40{\%} average time savings when using Rayyan compared to others tools, with 34{\%} of the respondents reporting more than 50{\%} time savings. In addition, around 75{\%} of the respondents mentioned that screening and labeling studies as well as collaborating on reviews to be the two most important features of Rayyan. As of November 2016, Rayyan users exceed 2000 from over 60 countries conducting hundreds of reviews totaling more than 1.6M citations. Feedback from users, obtained mostly through the app web site and a recent survey, has highlighted the ease in exploration of searches, the time saved, and simplicity in sharing and comparing include-exclude decisions. The strongest features of the app, identified and reported in user feedback, were its ability to help in screening and collaboration as well as the time savings it affords to users. CONCLUSIONS: Rayyan is responsive and intuitive in use with significant potential to lighten the load of reviewers.},

This increasing prevalence has implications for the risk of diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, and also for chronic kidney disease. A high body mass index is one of the strongest risk factors for new-onset chronic kidney disease. In individuals affected by obesity, a compensatory hyperfiltration occurs to meet the heightened metabolic demands of the increased body weight. The increase in intraglomerular pressure can damage the kidneys and raise the risk of developing chronic kidney disease in the long-term. The incidence of obesity-related glomerulopathy has increased 10-fold in recent years. Obesity has also been shown to be a risk factor for nephrolithiasis, and for a number of malignancies including kidney cancer. This year, the World Kidney Day promotes education on the harmful consequences of obesity and its association with kidney disease, advocating healthy lifestyle and health policy measures that make preventive behaviors an affordable option.},

abstract = {Associations between modifiable exposures and disease seen in observational epidemiology are sometimes confounded and thus misleading, despite our best efforts to improve the design and analysis of studies. Mendelian randomization—the random assortment of genes from parents to offspring that occurs during gamete formation and conception—provides one method for assessing the causal nature of some environmental exposures. The association between a disease and a polymorphism that mimics the biological link between a proposed exposure and disease is not generally susceptible to the reverse causation or confounding that may distort interpretations of conventional observational studies. Several examples where the phenotypic effects of polymorphisms are well documented provide encouraging evidence of the explanatory power of Mendelian randomization and are described. The limitations of the approach include confounding by polymorphisms in linkage disequilibrium with the polymorphism under study, that polymorphisms may have several phenotypic effects associated with disease, the lack of suitable polymorphisms for studying modifiable exposures of interest, and canalization—the buffering of the effects of genetic variation during development. Nevertheless, Mendelian randomization provides new opportunities to test causality and demonstrates how investment in the human genome project may contribute to understanding and preventing the adverse effects on human health of modifiable exposures.Genetic epidemiology—the theme of this issue of the International Journal of Epidemiology—is seen by many to be the only future for epidemiology, perhaps reflecting a growing awareness of the limitations of observational epidemiology1 (Box 1). Genetic epidemiology is concerned with understanding heritable aspects of disease risk, individual susceptibility to disease, and ultimately with contributing to a comprehensive molecular understanding of pathogenesis. The massive investment and expansion of human genetics, if it is to return value for the common good, must be integrated into public health functions. The human genome epidemiology network (HuGE Net—http://www.cdc.gov/genetics/huge.htm) has been established to promote the use of genetic knowledge—in terms of genetic tests and services—for disease prevention and health promotion.2,3 A broad taxonomy of human genome studies of public health relevance has been developed4 (Box 2). In this issue of the IJE, we publish a paper by Miguel Porta,5 who highlights the need for a more rational approach to genetic testing, given the likely low penetrance of many genes associated with cancers,6 likening the role of the genome to a jazz score that is interpreted and developed through experience and context—and is seldom predictable. Such insights may well temper enthusiasm for genetic testing in populations. However, in parallel to the approaches advocated by HuGE, genetic epidemiology can lead to a more robust understanding of environmental determinants of disease (e.g. dietary factors, occupational exposures, and health-related behaviours) relevant to whole populations (and not simply to genetically susceptible sub-populations).7–10 This approach has recently been referred to as ‘Mendelian randomization'.11–15 Here we begin by briefly reviewing reasons for current concerns about aetiological findings generated by conventional observational epidemiology and then we outline the potential contribution (and limitations) of Mendelian randomization.Box 1 ‘Epidemiology set to get fast-track treatment'‘A consortium of leading European research centres and pharmaceutical companies will this week announce a plan to transform epidemiology by combining it with the new techniques of high-throughput biology. They plan to create a new field of study—genomic epidemiology—by using screening technologies derived from the human genome project {\ldots} We think it is important to expand classical epidemiology and genetic epidemiology to take it to this high-throughput mode, says Esper Boel, vice-president of biotechnology research at Novo Nordisk.

Obesity has adverse effects on cardiovascular hemodynamics and cardiac structure and function, and increases the prevalence of AF, partly related to electroanatomic remodeling in obese patients.

However, these associations are insufficient to prove that intelligence and/or education cause these outcomes. Intelligence and education are phenotypically and genetically correlated, which makes it difficult to elucidate causal relationships. We used univariate and multivariable Mendelian randomization to estimate the total and direct effects of intelligence and educational attainment on mental and physical health, measures of socioeconomic position, and longevity. Both intelligence and education had beneficial total effects. Higher intelligence had positive direct effects on income and alcohol consumption, and negative direct effects on moderate and vigorous physical activity. Higher educational attainment had positive direct effects on income, alcohol consumption, and vigorous physical activity, and negative direct effects on smoking, BMI and sedentary behaviour. If the Mendelian randomization assumptions hold, these findings suggest that both intelligence and education affect health.},

Mediation approaches used in conventional epidemiology have been adapted to understanding the role of molecular intermediates in situations of high-dimensional omics data with varying degrees of success. In particular, the limitations of observational epidemiological study including confounding, reverse causation and measurement error can afflict conventional mediation approaches and may lead to incorrect conclusions regarding causal effects. Solutions to analysing mediation which overcome these problems include the use of instrumental variable methods such as Mendelian randomization, which may be applied to evaluate causality in increasingly complex networks of omics data.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT The metabolic state of the body can be a major determinant of bone health. We used a Mendelian randomization approach to identify metabolites causally associated with bone mass to better understand the biological mechanisms of osteoporosis. We tested bone phenotypes (femoral neck, total hip, and lumbar spine bone mineral density [BMD]) for association with 280 fasting blood metabolites in 6055 women from TwinsUK cohort with genomewide genotyping scans. Causal associations between metabolites and bone phenotypes were further assessed in a bidirectional Mendelian randomization study using genetic markers/scores as instrumental variables. Significant associations were replicated in 624 participants from the Hong Kong Osteoporosis Study (HKOS). Fifteen metabolites showed direct associations with bone phenotypes after adjusting for covariates and multiple testing. Using genetic instruments, four of these metabolites were found to be causally associated with hip or spine BMD. These included androsterone sulfate, epiandrosterone sulfate, 5alpha-androstan-3beta17beta-diol disulfate (encoded by CYP3A5), and 4-androsten-3beta17beta-diol disulfate (encoded by SULT2A1). In the HKOS population, all four metabolites showed significant associations with hip and spine BMD in the expected directions. No causal reverse association between BMD and any of the metabolites were found. In the first metabolome-genomewide Mendelian randomization study of human bone mineral density, we identified four novel biomarkers causally associated with BMD. Our findings reveal novel biological pathways involved in the pathogenesis of osteoporosis. ? 2017 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.},

New methods, large-scale genome-wide analyses, molecular epigenetics and other new -omics technologies are all providing exceptional opportunities for the exploitation of Mendelian randomization approaches to understand causes of complex traits and disease outcomes. This research has the potential to identify new approaches for the prevention and treatment of common conditions.The origins of what is now termed ‘Mendelian randomization' (Figure 1, see caption for assumptions) can be traced back over half a century,1 although the first extended presentation of the principles was in this journal just over a decade ago,2 Since then it has become a widely utilized methodology, with publications covering many branches of biomarker,3–12 behavioural13–16 and infectious disease17,18 epidemiology. Mendelian randomization studies with clear implications for pharmacotherapeutics are also becoming commonplace,19–21 and applications to social science and to economics (the field in which the statistical technique of instrumental variables analysis central to Mendelian randomization was initially conceived22) are being developed.23,24},

abstract = {Obesity increases a number of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, but patients with many types of CVD may have a better prognosis if classified as overweight or obese, a phenomenon known as the “obesity paradox”. This paradoxical benefit of a medically unfavorable phenotype is particularly strong in the overweight and class I obesity, and less pronounced in the more severe or morbidly obese populations (class II–III and greater). Rather than an obesity paradox, it is possible that this phenomenon may represent a “lean paradox”, in which individuals classified as normal weight or underweight may have a poorer prognosis with respect to CVD, as a result of a progressive catabolic state and lean mass loss. Cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) is a fundamental part of this discussion. A greater CRF is associated with lower CVD risk, regardless of body mass index (BMI). Also, the assessment of body composition compartments (i.e., fat mass, fat-free mass, lean mass) and the presence of metabolic derangements may be better indicators of CVD risk than BMI alone. The focus of this review is to summarize the current evidence of the obesity paradox. Moreover, we discuss the utility and limitations of BMI for cardiometabolic risk stratification, in addition to concepts such as “metabolically healthy obesity” (MHO) and the “fat but fit” phenomenon, which describe patients who are diagnosed with obesity using BMI, but without major metabolic derangements and with greater CRF, respectively. Finally, we propose that obese patients presenting with an excess body fat, yet without metabolic abnormalities, should still be viewed as an “at risk” population, and as such should receive advice to change their lifestyle to improve their CRF and to prevent the development of impaired fasting glucose, diabetes mellitus and other CVD risk factors as a form of primary prevention.},

abstract = {CONTEXT: Association between obesity and depression has repeatedly been established. For treatment and prevention purposes, it is important to acquire more insight into their longitudinal interaction., OBJECTIVE: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis on the longitudinal relationship between depression, overweight, and obesity and to identify possible influencing factors., DATA SOURCES: Studies were found using PubMed, PsycINFO, and EMBASE databases and selected on several criteria., STUDY SELECTION: Studies examining the longitudinal bidirectional relation between depression and overweight (body mass index 25-29.99) or obesity (body mass index {\textgreater} or =30) were selected., DATA EXTRACTION: Unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) were extracted or provided by the authors., DATA SYNTHESIS: Overall, unadjusted ORs were calculated and subgroup analyses were performed for the 15 included studies (N = 58 745) to estimate the effect of possible moderators (sex, age, depression severity). Obesity at baseline increased the risk of onset of depression at follow-up (unadjusted OR, 1.55; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 1.22-1.98; P {\textless} .001). This association was more pronounced among Americans than among Europeans (P = .05) and for depressive disorder than for depressive symptoms (P = .05). Overweight increased the risk of onset of depression at follow-up (unadjusted OR, 1.27; 95{\%} CI, 1.07-1.51; P {\textless} .01). This association was statistically significant among adults (aged 20-59 years and {\textgreater} or =60 years) but not among younger persons (aged {\textless}20 years). Baseline depression (symptoms and disorder) was not predictive of overweight over time. However, depression increased the odds for developing obesity (OR, 1.58; 95{\%} CI, 1.33-1.87; P {\textless} .001). Subgroup analyses did not reveal specific moderators of the association., CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis confirms a reciprocal link between depression and obesity. Obesity was found to increase the risk of depression, most pronounced among Americans and for clinically diagnosed depression. In addition, depression was found to be predictive of developing obesity.},

abstract = {Several associations between non-genetic biomarkers and colorectal cancer (CRC) risk have been detected, but the strength of evidence and the direction of associations are not confirmed. We aimed to evaluate the evidence of these associations and integrate results from different approaches to assess causal inference. We searched Medline and Embase for meta-analyses of observational studies, meta-analyses of randomized clinical trials (RCTs), and Mendelian randomization (MR) studies measuring the associations between non-genetic biomarkers and CRC risk and meta-analyses of RCTs on supplementary micronutrients. We repeated the meta-analyses using random-effects models and categorized the evidence based on predefined criteria. We described each MR study and evaluated their credibility. Seventy-two meta-analyses of observational studies and 18 MR studies on non-genetic biomarkers and six meta-analyses of RCTs on micronutrient intake and CRC risk considering 65, 42, and five unique associations, respectively, were identified. No meta-analyses of RCTs on blood level biomarkers have been found. None of the associations were classified as convincing or highly suggestive, three were classified as suggestive, and 26 were classified as weak. For three biomarkers explored in MR studies, there was evidence of causality and seven were classified as likely noncausal. For the first time, results from both observational and MR studies were integrated by triangulating the evidence for a wide variety of non-genetic biomarkers and CRC risk. At blood level, lower vitamin D, higher homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance, and human papillomavirus infection were associated with higher CRC risk while increased linoleic acid and oleic acid and decreased arachidonic acid were likely causally associated with lower CRC risk. No association was found convincing in both study types.},

abstract = {Background: Mendelian randomization (MR) is being increasingly used to strengthen causal inference in observational studies. Availability of summary data of genetic associations for a variety of phenotypes from large genome-wide association studies (GWAS) allows straightforward application of MR using summary data methods, typically in a two-sample design. In addition to the conventional inverse variance weighting (IVW) method, recently developed summary data MR methods, such as the MR-Egger and weighted median approaches, allow a relaxation of the instrumental variable assumptions. Methods: Here, a new method - the mode-based estimate (MBE) - is proposed to obtain a single causal effect estimate from multiple genetic instruments. The MBE is consistent when the largest number of similar (identical in infinite samples) individual-instrument causal effect estimates comes from valid instruments, even if the majority of instruments are invalid. We evaluate the performance of the method in simulations designed to mimic the two-sample summary data setting, and demonstrate its use by investigating the causal effect of plasma lipid fractions and urate levels on coronary heart disease risk. Results: The MBE presented less bias and lower type-I error rates than other methods under the null in many situations. Its power to detect a causal effect was smaller compared with the IVW and weighted median methods, but was larger than that of MR-Egger regression, with sample size requirements typically smaller than those available from GWAS consortia. Conclusions: The MBE relaxes the instrumental variable assumptions, and should be used in combination with other approaches in sensitivity analyses.},

abstract = {Cholesterol and triglycerides are insoluble in water and therefore these lipids must  be transported in association with proteins. Lipoproteins are complex particles with a central core containing cholesterol esters and triglycerides surrounded by free cholesterol, phospholipids, and apolipoproteins, which facilitate lipoprotein formation and function. Plasma lipoproteins can be divided into seven classes based on size, lipid composition, and apolipoproteins (chylomicrons, chylomicron remnants, VLDL, IDL, LDL, HDL, and Lp (a)). Chylomicron remnants, VLDL, IDL, LDL, and Lp (a) are all pro-atherogenic while HDL is anti-atherogenic. Apolipoproteins have four major functions including 1) serving a structural role, 2) acting as ligands for lipoprotein receptors, 3) guiding the formation of lipoproteins, and 4) serving as activators or inhibitors of enzymes involved in the metabolism of lipoproteins. The exogenous lipoprotein pathway starts with the incorporation of dietary lipids into chylomicrons in the intestine. In the circulation, the triglycerides carried in chylomicrons are metabolized in muscle and adipose tissue by lipoprotein lipase releasing free fatty acids, which are subsequently metabolized by muscle and adipose tissue, and chylomicron remnants are formed. Chylomicron remnants are then taken up by the liver. The endogenous lipoprotein pathway begins in the liver with the formation of VLDL. The triglycerides carried in VLDL are metabolized in muscle and adipose tissue by lipoprotein lipase releasing free fatty acids and IDL are formed. The IDL are further metabolized to LDL, which are taken up by the LDL receptor in numerous tissues including the liver, the predominant site of uptake. Reverse cholesterol transport begins with the formation of nascent HDL by the liver and intestine. These small HDL particles can then acquire cholesterol and phospholipids that are effluxed from cells, a process mediated by ABCA1 resulting in the formation of mature HDL. Mature HDL can acquire addition cholesterol from cells via ABCG1, SR-B1, or passive diffusion. The HDL then transports the cholesterol to the liver either directly by interacting with hepatic SR-B1 or indirectly by transferring the cholesterol to VLDL or LDL, a process facilitated by CETP. Cholesterol efflux from macrophages to HDL plays an important role in protecting from the development of atherosclerosis.

abstract = {Over the past decade, our view of human-associated microbes has expanded beyond that of a few species toward an appreciation of the diverse and niche-specialized microbial communities that develop in the human host with chronological age. The largest reservoir of microbes exists in the distal gastrointestinal tract, both in the lumen, where microbes facilitate primary and secondary metabolism, and on mucosal surfaces, where they interact with host immune cell populations. While local microbial-driven immunomodulation in the gut is well described, more recent studies have demonstrated a role for the gut microbiome in influencing remote organs and mucosal and hematopoietic immune function. Unsurprisingly, therefore, perturbation to the composition and function of the gut microbiota has been associated with chronic diseases ranging from gastrointestinal inflammatory and metabolic conditions to neurological, cardiovascular, and respiratory illnesses. Considerable effort is currently focused on understanding the natural history of microbiome development in humans in the context of health outcomes, in parallel with improving our knowledge of microbiome-host molecular interactions. These efforts ultimately aim to develop effective approaches to rehabilitate perturbed human microbial ecosystems as a means to restore health or prevent disease. This review details the role of the gut microbiome in modulating host health with a focus on immunomodulation and discusses strategies for manipulating the gut microbiome for the management or prevention of chronic inflammatory conditions.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Greater body mass index (BMI) has been convincingly related to increased endometrial cancer risk, however, whether adiposity earlier in life or abdominal fatness is an independent risk factor and whether weight gain or greater height increases the risk is not clear., METHODS: As part of the Continuous Update Project of the World Cancer Research Fund International, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective studies of the association between anthropometric measures and endometrial cancer risk and searched PubMed and several other databases up to February 2015. Summary relative risks (RRs) were calculated using a random-effects model., RESULTS: Thirty prospective studies of BMI and endometrial cancer risk with 22 320 cases among 6 445 402 participants were included. The summary RR for a 5-unit increment was 1.54 [95{\%} confidence interval (CI) 1.47-1.61, I(2) = 81{\%}]. Although the test for non-linearity was significant, Pnon-linearity {\textless} 0.0001, and the curve was steeper within the overweight and obese BMI ranges, there was evidence of increased risk even within the high normal BMI range. The summary RR was 1.45 (95{\%} CI 1.28-1.64, I(2) = 76{\%}) per 5 BMI units for BMI in young adulthood, 1.18 (95{\%} CI 1.14-1.23, I(2) = 67{\%}) per 5 kg increase of weight, and 1.16 (95{\%} CI 1.12-1.20, I(2) = 51{\%}) per 5 kg of weight gained between young adulthood and study baseline, 1.27 (95{\%} CI 1.17-1.39, I(2) = 71{\%}) per 10 cm increase in waist circumference, 1.21 (95{\%} CI 1.13-1.29, I(2) = 0{\%}) per 0.1-unit increment in waist-to-hip ratio and 1.30 (95{\%} CI 1.19-1.41, I(2) = 0{\%}) per 10-cm increase in hips circumference. The summary RR was 1.15 (95{\%} CI 1.09-1.22, I(2) = 61{\%}) for a 10-cm increase in height., CONCLUSIONS: All measures of adiposity were associated with increased risk of endometrial cancer, and in addition increasing height was associated with increased risk.

abstract = {What are the causal relationships between polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and body mass index (BMI)?Bidirectional Mendelian randomization analyses suggest that increased BMI is causal for PCOS while the reverse is not the case.The contribution of obesity to the pathogenesis of PCOS is controversial. To date, published genetic studies addressing this question have generated conflicting results and have not utilized the full extent of known single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with body mass index (BMI).This cross-sectional Mendelian randomization (MR) and genetic association study was conducted in 750 individuals of European origin and with PCOS and 1567 BMI-matched controls.Cases and controls were matched for BMI as well as for distribution of weight categories (normal weight, overweight, obese). Two-sample MR using inverse variance weighting (IVW) was conducted using a 92-SNP instrument variable for BMI with PCOS as the outcome, followed by two-sample MR with a 16-SNP instrument variable for PCOS with BMI as the outcome. Sensitivity analyses included MR-Egger and maximum likelihood methods. Secondary analyses assessed associations of genetic risk scores and individual SNPs with PCOS, BMI and quantitative androgen-related and glucose homeostasis-related traits.Each standard deviation genetically higher BMI was associated with a 4.89 (95{\%} CI 1.46–16.32) higher odds of PCOS. Conversely, genetic risk of PCOS did not influence BMI. Sensitivity analyses yielded directionally consistent results. The genetic risk score of 92 BMI SNPs was associated with the diagnosis of PCOS (OR 1.043, 95{\%} CI 1.009–1.078, P = 0.012). Of the 92 BMI risk variants evaluated, none were associated individually with PCOS after considering multiple testing. The association of FTO SNP rs1421085 with BMI was stronger in women with PCOS ($\beta$ = 0.071, P = 0.0006) than in controls ($\beta$ = 0.046, P = 0.065).The current sample size, while providing good power for MR and genetic risk score analyses, had limited power to demonstrate association of individual SNPs with PCOS. Cases and controls were not matched for age; however, this was mitigated by adjusting analyses for age. Dietary and lifestyle data, which could have been used to explore the greater association of the FTO SNP with BMI in women with PCOS, was not available.Increasing BMI appears to be causal for PCOS but having PCOS does not appear to affect BMI. This study used the most comprehensive set of SNPs for BMI currently available. Prior studies using fewer SNPs had yielded conflicting results and may have been confounded because cases and controls were not matched for weight categories. The current results highlight the potential utility of weight management in the prevention and treatment of PCOS.National Institutes of Health Grants R01-HD29364 and K24-HD01346 (to R.A.), Grant R01-DK79888 (to M.O.G.), Grant U54-HD034449 (to R.S.L.), Grant U19-HL069757 (to R.M.K.).

abstract = {Energy homeostasis is critical for the survival of species. Therefore, multiple and complex mechanisms have evolved to regulate energy intake and expenditure to maintain body weight. For weight maintenance, not only does energy intake have to match energy expenditure, but also macronutrient intake must balance macronutrient oxidation. However, this equilibrium seems to be particularly difficult to achieve in individuals with low fat oxidation, low energy expenditure, low sympathetic activity or low levels of spontaneous physical activity, as in addition to excess energy intake, all of these factors explain the tendency of some people to gain weight. Additionally, large variability in weight change is observed when energy surplus is imposed experimentally or spontaneously. Clearly, the data suggest a strong genetic influence on body weight regulation implying a normal physiology in an 'obesogenic' environment. In this study, we also review evidence that carbohydrate balance may represent the potential signal that regulates energy homeostasis by impacting energy intake and body weight. Because of the small storage capacity for carbohydrate and its importance for metabolism in many tissues and organs, carbohydrate balance must be maintained at a given level. This drive for balance may in turn cause increased energy intake when consuming a diet high in fat and low in carbohydrate. If sustained over time, such an increase in energy intake cannot be detected by available methods, but may cause meaningful increases in body weight. The concept of metabolic flexibility and its impact on body weight regulation is also presented.},

abstract = {Summary Body mass index (BMI) is the cornerstone of the current classification system for obesity and its advantages are widely exploited across disciplines ranging from international surveillance to individual patient assessment. However, like all anthropometric measurements, it is only a surrogate measure of body fatness. Obesity is defined as an excess accumulation of body fat, and it is the amount of this excess fat that correlates with ill-health. We propose therefore that much greater attention should be paid to the development of databases and standards based on the direct measurement of body fat in populations, rather than on surrogate measures. In support of this argument we illustrate a wide range of conditions in which surrogate anthropometric measures (especially BMI) provide misleading information about body fat content. These include: infancy and childhood; ageing; racial differences; athletes; military and civil forces personnel; weight loss with and without exercise; physical training; and special clinical circumstances. We argue that BMI continues to serve well for many purposes, but that the time is now right to initiate a gradual evolution beyond BMI towards standards based on actual measurements of body fat mass.},

abstract = {Both cholesterol esters (CE) and triacylglycerols (TG) are insoluble in water  (plasma); hence they are packaged as lipoproteins comprising an inner core of CE and TG with a surface coat of apolipoproteins, free cholesterol (FC), and phospholipids. Packaged as lipoproteins, they can be transported to various tissues where needed. By differing the lipid and protein concentrations, up to 5 different lipoproteins can be produced, such as chylomicrons, very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL), intermediate-density lipoproteins (IDL), low-density lipoproteins (LDL), and high-density lipoproteins (HDL). LDL is the predominant carrier of serum cholesterol (around 67{\%}) and delivers it to tissues of need such as the adrenal glands, gonads, and other tissues. With a density of 1.019 to 1.063 g/ml, LDL contains 20{\%} protein and 50{\%} cholesterol (CE and FC) and displays beta mobility on electrophoresis. This review focuses on LDL, especially its biochemistry, measurement, and clinical significance.},

abstract = {Oxygen consumption dedicated to respiratory work (V? o 2RESP) during quiet breathing is small in normal patients. In the morbidly obese, at high minute ventilations, V? o 2RESP is greater than in normal patients, but V? o 2RESP during quiet breathing in these patients is not known. We postulated that such patients have increased V? o 2RESP at rest which may predispose them to respiratory failure when additional respiratory workloads are imposed. We measured baseline V? o 2 in morbidly obese patients immediately prior to gastric bypass surgery and again after intubation, mechanical ventilation, and paralysis, and compared their change in V? o 2 to nonobese patients scheduled for elective abdominal surgery. Baseline V? o 2 was higher in the obese patients compared with control patients (354.6 versus 221.4 ml/min; p = 0.0001) and the change in V? o 2 from spontaneous breathing to mechanical ventilation was significant in the obese patients (354.6 versus 297.2 ml/min; p = 0.0002) but not the control patients (221.4 versus 219.8 ml/min; p = 0.86). We conclude that morbidly obese patients dedicate a disproportionately high percentage of total V? o 2 to conduct respiratory work, even during quiet breathing. This relative inefficiency suggests a decreased ventilatory reserve and a predisposition to respiratory failure in the setting of even mild pulmonary or systemic insults.},

The evidence was graded into strong, highly suggestive, suggestive, or weak after applying criteria that included the statistical significance of the random effects summary estimate and of the largest study in a meta-analysis, the number of cancer cases, heterogeneity between studies, 95{\%} prediction intervals, small study effects, excess significance bias, and sensitivity analysis with credibility ceilings.Results 204 meta-analyses investigated associations between seven indices of adiposity and developing or dying from 36 primary cancers and their subtypes. Of the 95 meta-analyses that included cohort studies and used a continuous scale to measure adiposity, only 12 (13{\%}) associations for nine cancers were supported by strong evidence. An increase in body mass index was associated with a higher risk of developing oesophageal adenocarcinoma; colon and rectal cancer in men; biliary tract system and pancreatic cancer; endometrial cancer in premenopausal women; kidney cancer; and multiple myeloma. Weight gain and waist to hip circumference ratio were associated with higher risks of postmenopausal breast cancer in women who have never used hormone replacement therapy and endometrial cancer, respectively. The increase in the risk of developing cancer for every 5 kg/m(2) increase in body mass index ranged from 9{\%} (relative risk 1.09, 95{\%} confidence interval 1.06 to 1.13) for rectal cancer among men to 56{\%} (1.56, 1.34 to 1.81) for biliary tract system cancer. The risk of postmenopausal breast cancer among women who have never used HRT increased by 11{\%} for each 5 kg of weight gain in adulthood (1.11, 1.09 to 1.13), and the risk of endometrial cancer increased by 21{\%} for each 0.1 increase in waist to hip ratio (1.21, 1.13 to 1.29). Five additional associations were supported by strong evidence when categorical measures of adiposity were included: weight gain with colorectal cancer; body mass index with gallbladder, gastric cardia, and ovarian cancer; and multiple myeloma mortality.Conclusions Although the association of adiposity with cancer risk has been extensively studied, associations for only 11 cancers (oesophageal adenocarcinoma, multiple myeloma, and cancers of the gastric cardia, colon, rectum, biliary tract system, pancreas, breast, endometrium, ovary, and kidney) were supported by strong evidence. Other associations could be genuine, but substantial uncertainty remains. Obesity is becoming one of the biggest problems in public health; evidence on the strength of the associated risks may allow finer selection of those at higher risk of cancer, who could be targeted for personalised prevention strategies.},

Physiol Rev 84: 277?359, 2004; 10.1152/physrev.00015.2003.?The function of brown adipose tissue is to transfer energy from food into heat; physiologically, both the heat produced and the resulting decrease in metabolic efficiency can be of significance. Both the acute activity of the tissue, i.e., the heat production, and the recruitment process in the tissue (that results in a higher thermogenic capacity) are under the control of norepinephrine released from sympathetic nerves. In thermoregulatory thermogenesis, brown adipose tissue is essential for classical nonshivering thermogen-esis (this phenomenon does not exist in the absence of functional brown adipose tissue), as well as for the cold acclimation-recruited norepinephrine-induced thermogenesis. Heat production from brown adipose tissue is activated whenever the organism is in need of extra heat, e.g., postnatally, during entry into a febrile state, and during arousal from hibernation, and the rate of thermogenesis is centrally controlled via a pathway initiated in the hypothalamus. Feeding as such also results in activation of brown adipose tissue; a series of diets, apparently all characterized by being low in protein, result in a leptin-dependent recruitment of the tissue; this metaboloregulatory thermogenesis is also under hypothalamic control. When the tissue is active, high amounts of lipids and glucose are combusted in the tissue. The development of brown adipose tissue with its characteristic protein, uncoupling protein-1 (UCP1), was probably determinative for the evolutionary success of mammals, as its thermogenesis enhances neonatal survival and allows for active life even in cold surroundings.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE The obesity paradox in which overweight/obesity is associated with mortality benefits is believed to be explained by confounding and reverse causality rather than by a genuine clinical benefit of excess body weight. We aimed to gain deeper insights into the paradox through analyzing mortality relationships with several adiposity measures; assessing subgroups with type 2 diabetes, with coronary heart disease (CHD), with cancer, and by smoking status; and adjusting for several confounders.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We studied the general UK Biobank population (N = 502,631) along with three subgroups of people with type 2 diabetes (n = 23,842), CHD (n = 24,268), and cancer (n = 45,790) at baseline. A range of adiposity exposures were considered, including BMI (continuous and categorical), waist circumference, body fat percentage, and waist-to-hip ratio, and the outcome was all-cause mortality. We used Cox regression models adjusted for age, smoking status, deprivation index, education, and disease history.RESULTS For BMI, the obesity paradox was observed among people with type 2 diabetes (adjusted hazard ratio for obese vs. normal BMI 0.78 [95{\%} CI 0.65, 0.95]) but not among those with CHD (1.00 [0.86, 1.17]). The obesity paradox was pronounced in current smokers, absent in never smokers, and more pronounced in men than in women. For other adiposity measures, there was less evidence for an obesity paradox, yet smoking status consistently modified the adiposity-mortality relationship.CONCLUSIONS The obesity paradox was observed in people with type 2 diabetes and is heavily modified by smoking status. The results of subgroup analyses and statistical adjustments are consistent with reverse causality and confounding.},

abstract = {GOALS: This study was undertaken to evaluate the effects of probiotics on adult  patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) through clinical parameters and H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabonomics. BACKGROUND: As systematic effect of probiotics on inflammatory bowel disease through metabonomics approach has been extensively studied to date, metabonomic characterization of the probiotics effect on IBS is also needed for better understanding the effect with respect to host metabolic mechanism. STUDY: Seventy-four IBS patients meeting Rome criteria were randomized to receive probiotics and placebo through a parallel-group, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical study. Probiotic fermented milk and placebo were administered 3 times daily for 8 weeks. Improvements of IBS were assessed according to Rome III questionnaires and H NMR metabolic profiling of serum and fecal samples from all participants was used to characterize a significant change in serum and fecal metabolome before and after probiotics. RESULTS: Fecal counts of the Lactobacilli, but not Bifidobacteria species, which included in the probiotic milk, were increased significantly in feces of IBS patients receiving treatment (P=0.014). NMR data set coupled with multivariate statistical analysis identified intrinsically elevated serum levels of glucose (P=0.0265) and tyrosine (P=0.0016) in IBS patients. These levels normalized to those of healthy individuals in the probiotic administration group, but not the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: This metabonomic study suggests that in a subset of IBS patients there exists a potential dysregulation in energy homeostasis (serum glucose) and liver function (serum tyrosine) that may be improved through probiotics supplementation. Moreover, global metabolic profiling highlights the potential of metabonomic approach for assessing bowel diseases or symptoms with respect to host metabolic perturbation.},

We repeated this analysis using genetic variants independent of the leading association at core HDL pathway genes and found that these variants were also associated with risk for breast cancers (OR=1.11, 95{\%} CI=1.06–1.16, P=1.5×10−6), including gene-specific associations at ABCA1, APOE-APOC1-APOC4-APOC2 and CETP. In addition, we find evidence that genetic variation at the ABO locus affects both lipid levels and breast cancer.Conclusions Genetically elevated plasma HDL levels appear to increase breast cancer risk. Future studies are required to understand the mechanism underlying this putative causal relationship, with the goal to develop potential therapeutic strategies aimed at altering the HDL-mediated effect on breast cancer risk.},

abstract = {There is an epidemic of diabetes in Asia. Type 2 diabetes develops in East Asian patients at a lower mean body mass index (BMI) compared with those of European descent. At any given BMI, East Asians have a greater amount of body fat and a tendency to visceral adiposity. In Asian patients, diabetes develops at a younger age and is characterized by early $\beta$ cell dysfunction in the setting of insulin resistance, with many requiring early insulin treatment. The increasing proportion of young-onset and childhood type 2 diabetes is posing a particular threat, with these patients being at increased risk of developing diabetic complications. East Asian patients with type 2 diabetes have a higher risk of developing renal complications than Europeans and, with regard to cardiovascular complications, a predisposition for developing strokes. In addition to cardiovascular-renal disease, cancer is emerging as the other main cause of mortality. While more research is needed to explain these interethnic differences, urgent and concerted actions are needed to raise awareness, facilitate early diagnosis, and encourage preventive strategies to combat these growing disease burdens.},

abstract = {Obesity is an independent risk factor for the development and progression of coronary heart disease (CHD). Over 80{\%} of patients with CHD are overweight or obese. While obesity is often considered a relatively "minor" CHD risk factor, weight loss is a broadly effective risk-factor intervention. Weight loss can profoundly influence a number of "major" risk factors including: hypertension, dyslipidemia and insulin resistance/type 2 diabetes mellitus. Despite its prominence as a risk factor most cardiac rehabilitation (CR) programs do not have a specific, targeted intervention to assist patients with weight loss. Consequently, the weight loss that occurs during CR is quite small and unlikely to appreciably alter risk factors. Relying on CR associated exercise as a sole intervention is an ineffective strategy to promote weight loss. There is evidence, however, that behavioral weight loss (BWL) interventions can be effectively employed in the CR setting. In contrast to programs that do not offer a targeted intervention, studies show that participants in CR-related BWL programs lose significantly more weight. The additional weight loss from the BWL intervention is associated with greater improvements in insulin sensitivity and other components of the metabolic syndrome such as hypertension and lipid abnormalities. As a means of maximizing CHD risk factor reduction CR programs need to incorporate BWL programs as a standard programming for overweight/obese patients.},

abstract = {Adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) has been discovered 14 years ago and revised our view on intracellular triglyceride (TG) mobilization – a process termed lipolysis. ATGL initiates the hydrolysis of TGs to release fatty acids (FAs) that are crucial energy substrates, precursors for the synthesis of membrane lipids, and ligands of nuclear receptors. Thus, ATGL is a key enzyme in whole-body energy homeostasis. In this review, we give an update on how ATGL is regulated on the transcriptional and post-transcriptional level and how this affects the enzymes' activity in the context of neutral lipid catabolism. In depth, we highlight and discuss the numerous physiological functions of ATGL in lipid and energy metabolism. Over more than a decade, different genetic mouse models lacking or overexpressing ATGL in a cell- or tissue-specific manner have been generated and characterized. Moreover, pharmacological studies became available due to the development of a specific murine ATGL inhibitor (Atglistatin{\textregistered}). The identification of patients with mutations in the human gene encoding ATGL and their disease spectrum has underpinned the importance of ATGL in humans. Together, mouse models and human data have advanced our understanding of the physiological role of ATGL in lipid and energy metabolism in adipose and non-adipose tissues, and of the pathophysiological consequences of ATGL dysfunction in mice and men.},

METHODS AND RESULTS: We measured fasting branched-chain and aromatic amino acids (tryptophan, tyrosine, and phenylalanine) by mass spectrometry in 111 overweight to obese subjects. We applied abdominal magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy to assess adipose tissue distribution and ectopic fat storage, respectively. Plasma branched-chain amino acids concentrations were related to insulin sensitivity and intrahepatic fat independent from adiposity, age and gender, but not to abdominal adipose tissue or intramyocellular fat. CONCLUSIONS: In weight stable overweight and obese individuals, branched-chain amino acid concentrations are specifically associated with hepatic fat storage and insulin resistance.},

We combined a proteomic approach with Mendelian randomization (MR) to identify possible new aspirin targets that decrease CRC risk.Methods: Human colorectal adenoma cells (RG/C2) were treated with aspirin (24 hours) and a stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) based proteomics approach identified altered protein expression. Protein quantitative trait loci (pQTLs) from INTERVAL (N = 3,301) and expression QTLs (eQTLs) from the eQTLGen Consortium (N = 31,684) were used as genetic proxies for protein and mRNA expression levels. Two-sample MR of mRNA/protein expression on CRC risk was performed using eQTL/pQTL data combined with CRC genetic summary data from the Colon Cancer Family Registry (CCFR), Colorectal Transdisciplinary (CORECT), Genetics and Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer (GECCO) consortia and UK Biobank (55,168 cases and 65,160 controls).Results: Altered expression was detected for 125/5886 proteins. Of these, aspirin decreased MCM6, RRM2, and ARFIP2 expression, and MR analysis showed that a standard deviation increase in mRNA/protein expression was associated with increased CRC risk (OR: 1.08, 95{\%} CI, 1.03–1.13; OR: 3.33, 95{\%} CI, 2.46–4.50; and OR: 1.15, 95{\%} CI, 1.02–1.29, respectively).Conclusions: MCM6 and RRM2 are involved in DNA repair whereby reduced expression may lead to increased DNA aberrations and ultimately cancer cell death, whereas ARFIP2 is involved in actin cytoskeletal regulation, indicating a possible role in aspirin{\&}{\#}039;s reduction of metastasis.Impact: Our approach has shown how laboratory experiments and population-based approaches can combine to identify aspirin-targeted proteins possibly affecting CRC risk.},

Stool samples from 113 individuals (UC 48, CD 44, controls 21) were analyzed by (1)H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (Bruker 600 MHz, Bruker BioSpin, Rheinstetten, Germany). Data were analyzed with principal component analysis and orthogonal-projection to latent structure-discriminant analysis using SIMCA-P + 12 and MATLAB. Significant differences were found in the metabolic profiles making it possible to differentiate between active IBD and controls and between UC and CD. The metabolites holding differential power primarily belonged to a range of amino acids, microbiota-related short chain fatty acids, and lactate suggestive of an inflammation-driven malabsorption and dysbiosis of the normal bacterial ecology. However, removal of patients with intestinal surgery and anti-TNF-$\alpha$ antibody treatment eliminated the discriminative power regarding UC versus CD. This study consequently demonstrates that (1)H NMR spectroscopy of fecal extracts is a potential non-invasive diagnostic tool and able to characterize the inflammation-driven changes in the metabolic profiles related to malabsorption and dysbiosis. Intestinal surgery and medication are to be accounted for in future studies, as it seems to be factors of importance in the discriminative process.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Although obesity is recognized as an important risk of mortality, how the amount and distribution of body fat affect mortality risk is unclear. Furthermore, whether fat distribution confers any additional risk of mortality in addition to fat amount is not understood. METHODS: This data linkage cohort study included 16415 participants (8554 females) aged 18 to 89 years from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III (1988-1994) and its linked mortality data (31 December 2011). Cox proportional hazard models and parametric survival models were used to estimate the association between body fat percentage (BF{\%}), based on bioelectrical impedance analysis, and waist-hip ratio (WHR) with mortality. RESULTS: A total of 4999 deaths occurred during 19-year follow-up. A U-shaped association between BF{\%} and mortality was found in both sexes, with the adjusted hazard ratios for other groups between 1.02 (95{\%} confidence interval: 0.89, 1.18) and 2.10 (1.47, 3.01) when BF{\%} groups of 25-30{\%} in males and 30-35{\%} in females were used as references. A non-linear relationship between WHR and mortality was detected in males, with the adjusted hazard ratios among other groups ranging from 1.05 (0.94, 1.18) to 1.52 (1.15, 2.00) compared with the WHR category of 0.95-1.0. However in females, the death risk constantly increased across the WHR spectrum. Joint impact of BF{\%} and WHR suggested males with BF{\%} of 25-30{\%} and WHR of 0.95-1.0 and females with BF{\%} of 30-35{\%} and WHR {\textless}0.9 were associated with the lowest mortality risk and longest survival age compared with their counterparts in other categories. CONCLUSIONS: This study supported the use of body fat distribution in addition to fat amount in assessing the risk of all-cause mortality.},

abstract = {Psychopathology represents a leading cause of disability worldwide. Effective interventions need to target risk factors that are causally related to psychopathology. In order to distinguish between causal and spurious risk factors, it is critical to account for environmental and genetic confounding. Mendelian randomisation studies use genetic variants that are independent from environmental and genetic confounders in order to strengthen causal inference. We conducted a systematic review of studies (N = 19) using Mendelian randomisation to examine the causal role of putative risk factors for psychopathology-related outcomes including depression, anxiety, psychological distress, schizophrenia, substance abuse/antisocial behaviour, and smoking initiation. The most commonly examined risk factors in the reviewed Mendelian randomisation studies were smoking, alcohol use and body mass index. In most cases, risk factors were strongly associated with psychopathology-related outcomes in conventional analyses but Mendelian randomisation indicated that these associations were unlikely to be causal. However, Mendelian randomisation analyses showed that both smoking and homocysteine plasma levels may be causally linked with schizophrenia.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prior research yielded conflicting results about the magnitude of the association between body mass index (BMI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTINGS {\&} PARTICIPANTS: Framingham Offspring participants (n = 2,676; 52{\%} women; mean age, 43 years) free of stage 3 CKD at baseline who participated in examination cycles 2 (1978-1981) and 7 (1998-2001). PREDICTOR: BMI. OUTCOME: Stage 3 CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate {\textless} 59 mL/min/1.73 m(2) for women and {\textless} 64 mL/min/1.73 m(2) for men). MEASUREMENTS: Age-, sex-, and multivariable-adjusted (diabetes, systolic blood pressure, hypertension treatment, current smoking status, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level) logistic regression models were used to examine the relationship between BMI at baseline and incident stage 3 CKD and incident dipstick proteinuria (trace or greater). RESULTS: At baseline, 36{\%} of the sample was overweight and 12{\%} was obese; 7.9{\%} (n = 212) developed stage 3 CKD during 18.5 years of follow-up. Relative to participants with normal BMI, there was no association between overweight individuals and stage 3 CKD incidence in age- and sex-adjusted models (odds ratio [OR], 1.29; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 0.93 to 1.81; P = 0.1) or multivariable models (OR, 1.06; 95{\%} CI, 0.75 to 1.50; P = 0.8). Obese individuals had a 68{\%} increased odds of developing stage 3 CKD (OR, 1.68; 95{\%} CI, 1.10 to 2.57; P = 0.02), which became nonsignificant in multivariable models (OR, 1.09; 95{\%} CI, 0.69 to 1.73; P = 0.7). Similar findings were observed when BMI was modeled as a continuous variable or quartiles. Incident proteinuria occurred in 14.4{\%}; overweight and obese individuals were at increased odds of proteinuria in multivariable models (OR, 1.43; 95{\%} CI, 1.09 to 1.88; OR, 1.56; 95{\%} CI, 1.08 to 2.26, respectively). LIMITATIONS: BMI is measure of generalized obesity and not abdominal obesity. Participants are predominantly white, and these findings may not apply to different ethnic groups. CONCLUSIONS: Obesity is associated with increased risk of developing stage 3 CKD, which was no longer significant after adjustment for known cardiovascular disease risk factors. The relationship between obesity and stage 3 CKD may be mediated through cardiovascular disease risk factors.},

abstract = {Endometrial cancer is the most common malignancy of the female genital tract and a major cause of morbidity and mortality in women. Early detection is key to ensuring good outcomes but a lack of minimally invasive screening tools is a significant barrier. Most endometrial cancers are obesity-driven and develop in the context of severe metabolomic dysfunction. Blood-derived metabolites may therefore provide clinically relevant biomarkers for endometrial cancer detection. In this study, we analysed plasma samples of women with body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m2 and endometrioid endometrial cancer (cases, n = 67) or histologically normal endometrium (controls, n = 69), using a mass spectrometry-based metabolomics approach. Eighty percent of the samples were randomly selected to serve as a training set and the remaining 20{\%} were used to qualify test performance. Robust predictive models (AUC {\textgreater} 0.9) for endometrial cancer detection based on artificial intelligence algorithms were developed and validated. Phospholipids were of significance as biomarkers of endometrial cancer, with sphingolipids (sphingomyelins) discriminatory in post-menopausal women. An algorithm combining the top ten performing metabolites showed 92.6{\%} prediction accuracy (AUC of 0.95) for endometrial cancer detection. These results suggest that a simple blood test could enable the early detection of endometrial cancer and provide the basis for a minimally invasive screening tool for women with a BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2.},

abstract = {Blood glucose concentrations are controlled by a loop incorporating two components, the beta cells which secrete insulin and the insulin-sensitive tissues (liver, muscle, adipose) which respond to it. Loss of blood glucose control might result from failure of the beta cells to secrete insulin, resistance of the tissues to its action, or a combination of both. The distinctions between Type I (insulin-dependent) and Type II (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus are becoming increasingly blurred both clinically and aetiologically, where beta-cell insufficiency is the shared characteristic. The 'Accelerator Hypothesis' identifies three processes which variably accelerate the loss of beta cells through apoptosis: constitution, insulin resistance and autoimmunity. None of the accelerators leads to diabetes without excess weight gain, a trend which the 'Accelerator Hypothesis' deems central to the rising incidence of both types of diabetes in the industrially developed world. Weight gain causes an increase in insulin resistance, which results in the weakening of glucose control. The rising blood glucose (glucotoxicity) accelerates beta-cell apoptosis directly in all and, by inducing beta-cell immunogens, further accelerates it in a subset genetically predisposed to autoimmunity. Rather than overlap between two types of diabetes, the 'Accelerator Hypothesis' envisages overlay. Body mass is central to the development and rising incidence of all diabetes. Only tempo distinguishes the 'types'. The control of weight gain, and with it insulin resistance, could be the means of minimising both.},

abstract = {In addition to the established association between general obesity and breast cancer risk, central obesity and circulating fasting insulin and glucose have been linked to the development of this common malignancy. Findings from previous studies, however, have been inconsistent, and the nature of the associations is unclear.We conducted Mendelian randomization analyses to evaluate the association of breast cancer risk, using genetic instruments, with fasting insulin, fasting glucose, 2-h glucose, body mass index (BMI) and BMI-adjusted waist-hip-ratio (WHRadj BMI). We first confirmed the association of these instruments with type 2 diabetes risk in a large diabetes genome-wide association study consortium. We then investigated their associations with breast cancer risk using individual-level data obtained from 98 842 cases and 83 464 controls of European descent in the Breast Cancer Association Consortium.All sets of instruments were associated with risk of type 2 diabetes. Associations with breast cancer risk were found for genetically predicted fasting insulin [odds ratio (OR) = 1.71 per standard deviation (SD) increase, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI) = 1.26-2.31, p  =  5.09  ×  10–4], 2-h glucose (OR = 1.80 per SD increase, 95{\%} CI = 1.3 0-2.49, p  =  4.02  ×  10–4), BMI (OR = 0.70 per 5-unit increase, 95{\%} CI = 0.65-0.76, p  =  5.05  ×  10–19) and WHRadj BMI (OR = 0.85, 95{\%} CI = 0.79-0.91, p  =  9.22  ×  10–6). Stratified analyses showed that genetically predicted fasting insulin was more closely related to risk of estrogen-receptor [ER]-positive cancer, whereas the associations with instruments of 2-h glucose, BMI and WHRadj BMI were consistent regardless of age, menopausal status, estrogen receptor status and family history of breast cancer.We confirmed the previously reported inverse association of genetically predicted BMI with breast cancer risk, and showed a positive association of genetically predicted fasting insulin and 2-h glucose and an inverse association of WHRadj BMI with breast cancer risk. Our study suggests that genetically determined obesity and glucose/insulin-related traits have an important role in the aetiology of breast cancer.},

During a mean of 21.4 years of follow-up, 12 356 deaths were identified. A J shaped association was consistently observed between BMI and all cause mortality. Multivariable adjusted Cox models including predicted fat mass and lean body mass showed a strong positive monotonic association between predicted fat mass and all cause mortality. Compared with those in the lowest fifth of predicted fat mass, men in the highest fifth had a hazard ratio of 1.35 (95{\%} confidence interval 1.26 to 1.46) for mortality from all causes. In contrast, a U shaped association was found between predicted lean body mass and all cause mortality. Compared with those in the lowest fifth of predicted lean body mass, men in the second to fourth fifths had 8-10{\%} lower risk of mortality from all causes. In the restricted cubic spline models, the risk of all cause mortality was relatively flat until 21 kg of predicted fat mass and increased rapidly afterwards, with a hazard ratio of 1.22 (1.18 to 1.26) per standard deviation. For predicted lean body mass, a large reduction of the risk was seen within the lower range until 56 kg, with a hazard ratio of 0.87 (0.82 to 0.92) per standard deviation, which increased thereafter (P for non-linearity {\&}lt;0.001). For cause specific mortality, men in the highest fifth of predicted fat mass had hazard ratios of 1.67 (1.47 to 1.89) for cardiovascular disease, 1.24 (1.09 to 1.43) for cancer, and 1.26 (0.97 to 1.64) for respiratory disease. On the other hand, a U shaped association was found between predicted lean body mass and mortality from cardiovascular disease and cancer. However, a strong inverse association existed between predicted lean body mass and mortality from respiratory disease (P for trend {\&}lt;0.001).Conclusions The shape of the association between BMI and mortality was determined by the relation between two body components (lean body mass and fat mass) and mortality. This finding suggests that the “obesity paradox” controversy may be largely explained by low lean body mass, rather than low fat mass, in the lower range of BMI.},

abstract = {Endometrial cancer is associated with metabolic disturbances related to its underlying risk factors, including obesity and diabetes. Identifying metabolite biomarkers associated with endometrial cancer may have value for early detection, risk assessment, and understanding etiology.The objective of the study was to evaluate the reliable measurement of metabolites in epidemiological studies with nonstandardized blood collection; confirm previously reported correlations of metabolites with body size; and assess differences in metabolite levels between cases and controls.This was the Polish Endometrial Cancer Study (2001–2003).This study was a population-based case-control study.Patients included 250 cases and 250 controls.The intervention included the measurement of serum metabolite levels of 15 amino acids, 45 acylcarnitines, and nine fatty acids.The main outcome measure was endometrial cancer.Body mass index was correlated with levels of valine (r = 0.26, P = 3.4 × 10−5), octenoylcarnitine (r = 0.24, P = 1.5 × 10−4), palmitic acid (r = 0.26, P = 4.4 × 10−5), oleic acid (r = 0.28, P = 9.9 × 10−6), and stearic acid (r = 0.26, P = 2.9 × 10−5) among controls. Only stearic acid was inversely associated with endometrial cancer case status (quartile 4 vs. quartile 1: odds ratio 0.37, 95{\%} confidence interval 0.20–0.69, P for trend = 1.2 × 10−4). Levels of the C5-acylcarnitines, octenoylcarnitine, decatrienoylcarnitine, and linoleic acid were significantly lower in cases than controls (odds ratios ranged from 0.21 to 0.38).These data demonstrate that previously reported variations in metabolomic profiles with body mass index can be replicated in population-based studies with nonfasting blood collection protocols. We also provide preliminary evidence that large differences in metabolite levels exist between cases and controls, independent of body habitus. Our findings warrant assessment of metabolic profiles, including the candidate markers identified herein, in prospectively collected blood samples to define biomarkers and etiological factors related to endometrial cancer.},

abstract = {Evidence for a major role of genetic factors in the determination of body mass index (BMI) comes from studies of related individuals. Despite consistent evidence for a heritable component of BMI, estimates of BMI heritability vary widely between studies and the reasons for this remain unclear. While some variation is natural due to differences between populations and settings, study design factors may also explain some of the heterogeneity. We performed a systematic review that identified 88 independent estimates of BMI heritability from twin studies (total 140,525 twins) and 27 estimates from family studies (42,968 family members). BMI heritability estimates from twin studies ranged from 0.47 to 0.90 (5th/50th/95th centiles: 0.58/0.75/0.87) and were generally higher than those from family studies (range: 0.24-0.81; 5th/50th/95th centiles: 0.25/0.46/0.68). Meta-regression of the results from twin studies showed that BMI heritability estimates were 0.07 (P = 0.001) higher in children than in adults; estimates increased with mean age among childhood studies (+0.012/year, P = 0.002), but decreased with mean age in adult studies (-0.002/year, P = 0.002). Heritability estimates derived from AE twin models (which assume no contribution of shared environment) were 0.12 higher than those from ACE models (P {\textless} 0.001), whilst lower estimates were associated with self reported versus DNA-based determination of zygosity (-0.04, P = 0.02), and with self reported versus measured BMI (-0.05, P = 0.03). Although the observed differences in heritability according to aspects of study design are relatively small, together, the above factors explained 47{\%} of the heterogeneity in estimates of BMI heritability from twin studies. In summary, while some variation in BMI heritability is expected due to population-level differences, study design factors explained nearly half the heterogeneity reported in twin studies. The genetic contribution to BMI appears to vary with age and may have a greater influence during childhood than adult life.},

abstract = {Common genomic variants associated with obesity are interrogated for their potential implications for biological and behavioural mechanisms and their concordance with established risk factors for obesity.An integrative analysis, taking advantage of the recently available large data repositories on tissue-specific gene networks, expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and genome-wide promoter and enhancer location was undertaken, along with a review of evidence for phenotypic relevance through knockout mouse databases.Exploring panels of SNPs (n = 118 SNPs) from three large genome-wide association studies on adult and childhood adiposity confirms that central nervous system (CNS)-related processes dominate human variation in BMI, whereas peripheral signalling pathways are more evident in variability in percentage body fat.Several obesity-associated SNPs function as cis-eQTLs by altering the expression of nearby genes. Conditional analysis of the most significantly associated SNPs suggests that the majority of the obesity-associated SNPs tag other variants that may causally regulate nearby gene expression.A large fraction of obesity-associated SNPs (46 of 118 GWAS variants) are located primarily in non-coding, regulatory domains of the human genome and overlap with at least one promoter- or enhancer-associated histone modification mark, particularly across multiple brain regions.Knocked out genes proximal to the GWAS significant loci were interrogated in mouse databases for their potential convergence with obesity traits. The analysis identified 49 genes that displayed a relationship with more than one obesity trait when knocked out in mice.Overall, common genomic variants tend to occur in genes, pathways and networks influencing brain regulation of energy balance, an observation consistent with the current consensus on the aetiology of obesity. However, at present, these types of variants do not seem to strongly implicate other established determinants of obesity such as hormonal regulation, skeletal muscle metabolism and energy expenditure traits.},

abstract = {Visceral adipose tissue (VAT)-fat stored around the internal organs-has been  suggested as an independent risk factor for cardiovascular and metabolic disease(1-3), as well as all-cause, cardiovascular-specific and cancer-specific mortality(4,5). Yet, the contribution of genetics to VAT, as well as its disease-related effects, are largely unexplored due to the requirement for advanced imaging technologies to accurately measure VAT. Here, we develop sex-stratified, nonlinear prediction models (coefficient of determination = 0.76; typical 95{\%} confidence interval (CI) = 0.74-0.78) for VAT mass using the UK Biobank cohort. We performed a genome-wide association study for predicted VAT mass and identified 102 novel visceral adiposity loci. Predicted VAT mass was associated with increased risk of hypertension, heart attack/angina, type 2 diabetes and hyperlipidemia, and Mendelian randomization analysis showed visceral fat to be a causal risk factor for all four diseases. In particular, a large difference in causal effect between the sexes was found for type 2 diabetes, with an odds ratio of 7.34 (95{\%} CI = 4.48-12.0) in females and an odds ratio of 2.50 (95{\%} CI = 1.98-3.14) in males. Our findings bolster the role of visceral adiposity as a potentially independent risk factor, in particular for type 2 diabetes in Caucasian females. Independent validation in other cohorts is necessary to determine whether the findings can translate to other ethnicities, or outside the UK.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The relationship between central obesity and survival in community-dwelling adults with normal body mass index (BMI) is not well-known. OBJECTIVE: To examine total and cardiovascular mortality risks associated with central obesity and normal BMI. DESIGN: Stratified multistage probability design. SETTING: NHANES III (Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey). PARTICIPANTS: 15,184 adults (52.3{\%} women) aged 18 to 90 years. MEASUREMENTS: Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate the relationship of obesity patterns defined by BMI and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) and total and cardiovascular mortality risk after adjustment for confounding factors. RESULTS: Persons with normal-weight central obesity had the worst long-term survival. For example, a man with a normal BMI (22 kg/m2) and central obesity had greater total mortality risk than one with similar BMI but no central obesity (hazard ratio [HR], 1.87 [95{\%} CI, 1.53 to 2.29]), and this man had twice the mortality risk of participants who were overweight or obese according to BMI only (HR, 2.24 [CI, 1.52 to 3.32] and 2.42 [CI, 1.30 to 4.53], respectively). Women with normal-weight central obesity also had a higher mortality risk than those with similar BMI but no central obesity (HR, 1.48 [CI, 1.35 to 1.62]) and those who were obese according to BMI only (HR, 1.32 [CI, 1.15 to 1.51]). Expected survival estimates were consistently lower for those with central obesity when age and BMI were controlled for. LIMITATIONS: Body fat distribution was assessed based on anthropometric indicators alone. Information on comorbidities was collected by self-report. CONCLUSION: Normal-weight central obesity defined by WHR is associated with higher mortality than BMI-defined obesity, particularly in the absence of central fat distribution.

abstract = {Fatty acids (FAs) are important as metabolic substrates and as structural components  of biological membranes. However, they also function as signalling molecules. Recently, a series of G protein-coupled receptors (GPRs) for FAs has been described and characterized. These receptors have differing specificities for FAs of differing chain length and degree of saturation, for FA derivatives such as oleoylethanolamide, and for oxidized FAs. They are a critical component of the body's nutrient sensing apparatus, and small molecule agonists and antagonists of these receptors show considerable promise in the management of diabetes and its complications. Agonists of the long-chain free fatty acid receptors FFAR1 and GPR119 act as insulin secretagogues, both directly and by increasing incretins. Although, drugs acting at short-chain FFA receptors (FFAR2 and FFAR3) have not yet been developed, they are attractive targets as they regulate nutrient balance through effects in the intestine and adipose tissue. These include regulation of the secretion of cholecystokinin, peptide YY and leptin. Finally, GPR132 is a receptor for oxidized FAs, which may be a sensor of lipid overload and oxidative stress, and which is involved in atherosclerosis. Regulation of its signalling pathways with drugs may decrease the macrovascular risk experienced by diabetic patients. In summary, FA receptors are emerging drug targets that are involved in the regulation of nutrient status and carbohydrate tolerance, and modulators of these receptors may well figure prominently in the next generation of antidiabetic drugs.},

abstract = {Background: Methods for the assessment of changes in dietary intake across the life course are underdeveloped. Methods: We demonstrate the use of linear-spline multilevel models to summarize energy-intake trajectories through childhood and adolescence and their application as exposures, outcomes, or mediators. The Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children assessed children's dietary intake several times between ages 3 and 13 years, using both food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) and 3-day food diaries. We estimated energy-intake trajectories for 12,032 children using linear-spline multilevel models. We then assessed the associations of these trajectories with maternal body mass index (BMI), and later offspring BMI, and also their role in mediating the relation between maternal and offspring BMIs. Results: Models estimated average and individual energy intake at 3 years, and linear changes in energy intake from age 3 to 7 years and from age 7 to 13 years. By including the exposure (in this example, maternal BMI) in the multilevel model, we were able to estimate the average energy-intake trajectories across levels of the exposure. When energy-intake trajectories are the exposure for a later outcome (in this case offspring BMI) or a mediator (between maternal and offspring BMI), results were similar, whether using a two-step process (exporting individual-level intercepts and slopes from multilevel models and using these in linear regression/path analysis), or a single-step process (multivariate multilevel models). Trajectories were similar when FFQs and food diaries were assessed either separately, or when combined into one model. Conclusions: Linear-spline multilevel models provide useful summaries of trajectories of dietary intake that can be used as an exposure, outcome, or mediator.},

abstract = {Adipose tissue is a complex, essential, and highly active metabolic and endocrine organ. Besides adipocytes, adipose tissue contains connective tissue matrix, nerve tissue, stromovascular cells, and immune cells. Together these components function as an integrated unit. Adipose tissue not only responds to afferent signals from traditional hormone systems and the central nervous system but also expresses and secretes factors with important endocrine functions. These factors include leptin, other cytokines, adiponectin, complement components, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, proteins of the renin-angiotensin system, and resistin. Adipose tissue is also a major site for metabolism of sex steroids and glucocorticoids. The important endocrine function of adipose tissue is emphasized by the adverse metabolic consequences of both adipose tissue excess and deficiency. A better understanding of the endocrine function of adipose tissue will likely lead to more rational therapy for these increasingly prevalent disorders. This review presents an overview of the endocrine functions of adipose tissue.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Endometrial cancers have long been divided into estrogen-dependent type I and the less common clinically aggressive estrogen-independent type II. Little is known about risk factors for type II tumors because most studies lack sufficient cases to study these much less common tumors separately. We examined whether so-called classical endometrial cancer risk factors also influence the risk of type II tumors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Individual-level data from 10 cohort and 14 case-control studies from the Epidemiology of Endometrial Cancer Consortium were pooled. A total of 14,069 endometrial cancer cases and 35,312 controls were included. We classified endometrioid (n = 7,246), adenocarcinoma not otherwise specified (n = 4,830), and adenocarcinoma with squamous differentiation (n = 777) as type I tumors and serous (n = 508) and mixed cell (n = 346) as type II tumors. RESULTS: Parity, oral contraceptive use, cigarette smoking, age at menarche, and diabetes were associated with type I and type II tumors to similar extents. Body mass index, however, had a greater effect on type I tumors than on type II tumors: odds ratio (OR) per 2 kg/m(2) increase was 1.20 (95{\%} CI, 1.19 to 1.21) for type I and 1.12 (95{\%} CI, 1.09 to 1.14) for type II tumors (P heterogeneity {\textless} .0001). Risk factor patterns for high-grade endometrioid tumors and type II tumors were similar. CONCLUSION: The results of this pooled analysis suggest that the two endometrial cancer types share many common etiologic factors. The etiology of type II tumors may, therefore, not be completely estrogen independent, as previously believed.},

abstract = {Anorexia nervosa (AN) occurs nine times more often in females than in males. Although environmental factors likely play a role, the reasons for this imbalanced sex ratio remain unresolved. AN displays high genetic correlations with anthropometric and metabolic traits. Given sex differences in body composition, we investigated the possible metabolic underpinnings of female propensity for AN. We conducted sex-specific GWAS in a healthy and medication-free subsample of the UK Biobank (n = 155,961), identifying 77 genome-wide significant loci associated with body fat percentage (BF{\%}) and 174 with fat-free mass (FFM). Partitioned heritability analysis showed an enrichment for central nervous tissue-associated genes for BF{\%}, which was more prominent in females than males. Genetic correlations of BF{\%} and FFM with the largest GWAS of AN by the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium were estimated to explore shared genomics. The genetic correlations of BF{\%}(male) and BF{\%}(female) with AN differed significantly from each other (p {\textless} .0001, $\delta$ = -0.17), suggesting that the female preponderance in AN may, in part, be explained by sex-specific anthropometric and metabolic genetic factors increasing liability to AN.},

abstract = {Objective: The aim of this study was to develop and test the validity of a new repeatable method to delimit abdominal areas for follow-up of fat mass (FM) and lean tissue mass (LM) in DEXA examinations. Methods: 37 male volunteers underwent two DEXA examinations. Total body FM and LM measurements and corresponding abdominal measurements in a carefully defined region were calculated from the first scan. After repositioning of the subjects and a second scan, the delimited region was copied and the abdominal tissues re-calculated. Results: The mean LM of the abdominal area was 2.804 kg (SD 0.556), and the mean FM was 1.026 kg (SD 0.537). The intra-class correlation coefficient for the repeated abdominal LM, FM, and LM/FM ratio measurements was 0.99. The mean difference (bias) for the repeated abdominal LM measurements was -13 g (95{\%} confidence interval (CI) -193.0 to 166.8), and for the repeated abdominal FM measurements it was -35 g (95{\%} CI -178.9 to 108.5). Conclusions: The results indicate that regional DEXA is a sensitive method with excellent reproducibility in the measurements of the abdominal fat and lean tissues. The method may serve as a useful tool for evaluation and follow-up of various dietary and training programmes.},

Results 57 articles reporting 15 systematic reviews and144 meta-analyses of observational studies (76 unique outcomes), 8 articles reporting 31 meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials (20 unique outcomes), and 36 articles reporting 107 Mendelian randomisation studies (56 unique outcomes) met the eligibility criteria. Across all three study types, 136 unique health outcomes were reported. 16 unique outcomes in meta-analyses of observational studies had P{\&}lt;10-6, 8 unique outcomes in meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials had P{\&}lt;0.001, and 4 unique outcomes in Mendelian randomisation studies had P{\&}lt;0.01. Large between study heterogeneity was common (80{\%} and 45{\%} in meta-analyses of observational studies and of randomised controlled trials, respectively). 42 (55{\%}) meta-analyses of observational studies and 7 (35{\%}) meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials showed evidence of small study effects or excess significance bias. No associations from meta-analyses of observational studies were classified as convincing; five associations were classified as highly suggestive (increased risk of heart failure, hypertension, impaired fasting glucose or diabetes, chronic kidney disease, coronary heart disease mortality with high SUA levels). Only one outcome from randomised controlled trials (decreased risk of nephrolithiasis recurrence with SUA lowering treatment) had P{\&}lt;0.001, a 95{\%} prediction interval excluding the null, and no large heterogeneity or bias. Only one outcome from Mendelian randomisation studies (increased risk of gout with high SUA levels) presented convincing evidence. Hypertension and chronic kidney disease showed concordant evidence in meta-analyses of observational studies, and in some (but not all) meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials with respective intermediate or surrogate outcomes, but they were not statistically significant in Mendelian randomisation studies. Conclusion Despite a few hundred systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and Mendelian randomisation studies exploring 136 unique health outcomes, convincing evidence of a clear role of SUA level only exists for gout and nephrolithiasis.},

These adipose tissue phenotypes are influenced by adiposity, but there is also a strong hereditary impact. Polymorphisms in numerous adipose-expressed genes have been evaluated for association with adipocyte and clinical phenotypes. In our opinion, some results are convincing. Thus ADRB2 and GPR74 genes are associated with adipocyte lipolysis, GPR74 also with BMI; PPARG and SREBP1, which promote adipogenesis and lipid storage, are associated with T2D and possible adiposity; ADIPOQ and ARL15 are associated with circulating levels of adiponectin, ARL15 also with coronary heart disease. We anticipate that the use of complementary approaches such as expression profiling and RNAi screening, and studies of additional levels of gene regulation, that is, miRNA and epigenetics, will be important to unravel the genetics of adipose tissue function.},

abstract = {The worldwide obesity epidemic is stimulating efforts to identify host and environmental factors that affect energy balance. Comparisons of the distal gut microbiota of genetically obese mice and their lean littermates, as well as those of obese and lean human volunteers have revealed that obesity is associated with changes in the relative abundance of the two dominant bacterial divisions, the Bacteroidetes and the Firmicutes. Here we demonstrate through metagenomic and biochemical analyses that these changes affect the metabolic potential of the mouse gut microbiota. Our results indicate that the obese microbiome has an increased capacity to harvest energy from the diet. Furthermore, this trait is transmissible: colonization of germ-free mice with an ‘obese microbiota' results in a significantly greater increase in total body fat than colonization with a ‘lean microbiota'. These results identify the gut microbiota as an additional contributing factor to the pathophysiology of obesity.},

Similar results were also seen for body fat percentage and waist circumference in both UK Biobank and the TAG consortium data.Conclusions These results strongly suggest that higher adiposity influences smoking behaviour and could have implications for the implementation of public health interventions aiming to reduce the prevalence of these important risk factors.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The main associations of body-mass index (BMI) with overall and cause-specific mortality can best be assessed by long-term prospective follow-up of large numbers of people. The Prospective Studies Collaboration aimed to investigate these associations by sharing data from many studies. METHODS: Collaborative analyses were undertaken of baseline BMI versus mortality in 57 prospective studies with 894 576 participants, mostly in western Europe and North America (61{\%} [n=541 452] male, mean recruitment age 46 [SD 11] years, median recruitment year 1979 [IQR 1975-85], mean BMI 25 [SD 4] kg/m(2)). The analyses were adjusted for age, sex, smoking status, and study. To limit reverse causality, the first 5 years of follow-up were excluded, leaving 66 552 deaths of known cause during a mean of 8 (SD 6) further years of follow-up (mean age at death 67 [SD 10] years): 30 416 vascular; 2070 diabetic, renal or hepatic; 22 592 neoplastic; 3770 respiratory; 7704 other. FINDINGS: In both sexes, mortality was lowest at about 22.5-25 kg/m(2). Above this range, positive associations were recorded for several specific causes and inverse associations for none, the absolute excess risks for higher BMI and smoking were roughly additive, and each 5 kg/m(2) higher BMI was on average associated with about 30{\%} higher overall mortality (hazard ratio per 5 kg/m(2) [HR] 1.29 [95{\%} CI 1.27-1.32]): 40{\%} for vascular mortality (HR 1.41 [1.37-1.45]); 60-120{\%} for diabetic, renal, and hepatic mortality (HRs 2.16 [1.89-2.46], 1.59 [1.27-1.99], and 1.82 [1.59-2.09], respectively); 10{\%} for neoplastic mortality (HR 1.10 [1.06-1.15]); and 20{\%} for respiratory and for all other mortality (HRs 1.20 [1.07-1.34] and 1.20 [1.16-1.25], respectively). Below the range 22.5-25 kg/m(2), BMI was associated inversely with overall mortality, mainly because of strong inverse associations with respiratory disease and lung cancer. These inverse associations were much stronger for smokers than for non-smokers, despite cigarette consumption per smoker varying little with BMI. INTERPRETATION: Although other anthropometric measures (eg, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio) could well add extra information to BMI, and BMI to them, BMI is in itself a strong predictor of overall mortality both above and below the apparent optimum of about 22.5-25 kg/m(2). The progressive excess mortality above this range is due mainly to vascular disease and is probably largely causal. At 30-35 kg/m(2), median survival is reduced by 2-4 years; at 40-45 kg/m(2), it is reduced by 8-10 years (which is comparable with the effects of smoking). The definite excess mortality below 22.5 kg/m(2) is due mainly to smoking-related diseases, and is not fully explained.},

abstract = {The relationship between obesity and cognitive impairment is important given the globally ageing population in whom cognitive decline and neurodegenerative disorders will carry grave individual, societal and financial burdens. This review examines the evidence for the link between obesity and cognitive function in terms of both the immediate effects on cognitive performance, and effects on the trajectory of cognitive ageing and likelihood of dementia. In mid-life, there is a strong association between obesity and impaired cognitive function. Anthropometric measures of obesity are also associated with reduced neural integrity (e.g. grey and white matter atrophy). Increasing age coupled with the negative metabolic consequences of obesity (e.g. type 2 diabetes mellitus) are likely to significantly contribute to cognitive decline and incidence of dementia. Stress is identified as a potential risk factor promoting abdominal obesity and contributing to impaired cognitive function. However, the potentially protective effects of obesity against cognitive decline in older age require further examination. Finally, surgical and whole diet interventions, which address obesity may improve cognitive capacity and confer some protection against later cognitive decline. In conclusion, obesity and its comorbidities are associated with impaired cognitive performance, accelerated cognitive decline and neurodegenerative pathologies such as dementia in later life. Interventions targeting mid-life obesity may prove beneficial in reducing the cognitive risks associated with obesity.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Numerous risk factors for dementia are well established, though the causal nature of these associations remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: To systematically review Mendelian randomization (MR) studies investigating causal relationships between risk factors and global cognitive function or dementia. METHODS: We searched five databases from inception to February 2017 and conducted citation searches including MR studies investigating the association between any risk factor and global cognitive function, all-cause dementia or dementia subtypes. Two reviewers independently assessed titles and abstracts, full-texts, and study quality. RESULTS: We included 18 MR studies investigating education, lifestyle factors, cardiovascular factors and related biomarkers, diabetes related and other endocrine factors, and telomere length. Studies were of predominantly good quality, however eight received low ratings for sample size and statistical power. The most convincing causal evidence was found for an association of shorter telomeres with increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Causal evidence was weaker for smoking quantity, vitamin D, homocysteine, systolic blood pressure, fasting glucose, insulin sensitivity, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Well-replicated associations were not present for most exposures and we cannot fully discount survival and diagnostic bias, or the potential for pleiotropic effects. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic evidence supported a causal association between telomere length and AD, whereas limited evidence for other risk factors was largely inconclusive with tentative evidence for smoking quantity, vitamin D, homocysteine, and selected metabolic markers. The lack of stronger evidence for other risk factors may reflect insufficient statistical power. Larger well-designed MR studies would therefore help establish the causal status of these dementia risk factors.},

abstract = {Background: Genes and the environment contribute to variation in adult body mass index [BMI (in kg/m(2))], but factors modifying these variance components are poorly understood.Objective: We analyzed genetic and environmental variation in BMI between men and women from young adulthood to old age from the 1940s to the 2000s and between cultural-geographic regions representing high (North America and Australia), moderate (Europe), and low (East Asia) prevalence of obesity.Design: We used genetic structural equation modeling to analyze BMI in twins ≥20 y of age from 40 cohorts representing 20 countries (140,379 complete twin pairs).Results: The heritability of BMI decreased from 0.77 (95{\%} CI: 0.77, 0.78) and 0.75 (95{\%} CI: 0.74, 0.75) in men and women 20-29 y of age to 0.57 (95{\%} CI: 0.54, 0.60) and 0.59 (95{\%} CI: 0.53, 0.65) in men 70-79 y of age and women 80 y of age, respectively. The relative influence of unique environmental factors correspondingly increased. Differences in the sets of genes affecting BMI in men and women increased from 20-29 to 60-69 y of age. Mean BMI and variances in BMI increased from the 1940s to the 2000s and were greatest in North America and Australia, followed by Europe and East Asia. However, heritability estimates were largely similar over measurement years and between regions. There was no evidence of environmental factors shared by co-twins affecting BMI.Conclusions: The heritability of BMI decreased and differences in the sets of genes affecting BMI in men and women increased from young adulthood to old age. The heritability of BMI was largely similar between cultural-geographic regions and measurement years, despite large differences in mean BMI and variances in BMI. Our results show a strong influence of genetic factors on BMI, especially in early adulthood, regardless of the obesity level in the population.},

abstract = {Early growth is associated with future metabolic risk; however, little is known of the underlying biological pathways. In this prospective study of 249 boys and 227 girls, we sought to identify sex-specific metabolite profiles that mark the relationship between age and magnitude of the infancy body mass index (BMI) peak, and the childhood BMI rebound with a metabolic syndrome z-score (MetS z-score) during early adolescence (median age 12.8 years). Thirteen consensus metabolite networks were generated between male and female adolescents using weighted correlation network analysis. In girls, none of the networks were related to BMI milestones after false discovery rate (FDR) correction at 5{\%}. In boys, age and/or magnitude of BMI at rebound were associated with three metabolite eigenvector (ME) networks comprising androgen hormones (ME7), lysophospholipids (ME8), and diacylglycerols (ME11) after FDR correction. These networks were also associated with MetS z-score in boys after accounting for age and race/ethnicity: ME7 (1.43 [95{\%} CI: 0.52, 2.34] units higher MetS z-score per 1 unit of ME7), ME8 (-1.01 [95{\%} CI: -1.96, -0.07]), and ME11 (2.88 [95{\%} CI: 2.06, 3.70]). These findings suggest that alterations in sex steroid hormone and lipid metabolism are involved in the relationship of early growth with future metabolic risk in males.},

Up to four samples per individual were collected over 2 years giving a total of 124 samples. Multivariate discriminant analysis, based on NMR data from all three groups, was able to predict UC and C group membership with good sensitivity and specificity; classification of IBS samples was less successful and could not be used for diagnosis. Trends were detected toward increased taurine and cadaverine levels in UC with increased bile acid and decreased branched chain fatty acids in IBS relative to controls; changes in short chain fatty acids and amino acids were not significant. Previous PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) analysis of the same fecal material had shown alterations of the gut microbiota when comparing UC and IBS groups with controls. Hierarchical cluster analysis showed that DGGE profiles from the same individual were stable over time, but NMR spectra were more variable; canonical correlation analysis of NMR and DGGE data partly separated the three groups and revealed a correlation between the gut microbiota profile and metabolite composition.},

Anthropometric parameters, conventional metabolites, and biomarkers were measured. Metabolomic profiling was analyzed with UPLC-Q-TOF MS. Overweight/obese men showed higher levels of HOMA-IR, triglycerides, total cholesterol, and LDL-cholesterol, and lower levels of HDL-cholesterol and adiponectin than lean men. Overweight/obese men showed higher proportion of stearic acid and lower proportion of oleic acid in serum phospholipids. Additionally, overweight/obese individuals showed higher fat intake and lower ratio of polyunsaturated fatty acids to saturated fatty acids. We identified three lyso-phosphatidylcholine (lysoPC) as potential plasma markers and confirmed eight known metabolites for overweight/obesity men. Especially, overweight/obese subjects showed higher levels of lysoPC C14:0 and lysoPC C18:0 and lower levels of lysoPC C18:1 than lean subjects. Results confirmed abnormal metabolism of two branched-chain amino acids, two aromatic amino acids, and fatty acid synthesis and oxidation in overweight/obese men. Additionally, the amount of dietary saturated fat may influence the proportion of saturated fatty acids in serum phospholipids and the degree of saturation of the constituent acyl group of plasma lysoPC.},

abstract = {Obesity is defined as an excess accumulation of body fat. Measuring body fat accurately is difficult, and no method is easily available for routine clinical use. Common methods of exploring the levels of adiposity include body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, skinfolds, bioelectrical impedance analysis, dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), computerized tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Tra- ditionally, overweight or obese status has been evaluated by anthropometric measurement of weight-for-height. More recently, BMI has been used. The normal range is 19-24.9 kg/m2, overweight is 25-29.9 kg/m2, and obese is ≥ 30 kg/m2. However, the appropriateness of this definition among Asian individuals has been questioned. Asian individuals generally have a higher percentage of body fat than do Western individuals at the same BMI levels. Consequently, for the Korean population, overweight status is defined based on an increase in morbidity and obesity based on an increase in mortality; overweight is defined as a BMI of 23-24.9 kg/m2 and obese as a BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2. Simple anthropometric measure- ments can be used, such as waist circumference. A waist circumference greater than 102 cm in men and 88 cm in women is a risk factor for insulin resistance, diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease. Based on the World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations, the waist circumference (WC) cutoff for Asians was suggested as 90 cm for men and 80 cm for women, respectively, which was different from that of other ethnic groups, such as Europeans. For Koreans, abdominal obesity is defined as a WC ≥ 90 cm for men and ≥ 85 cm for women.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Elevated body mass index (BMI) is associated with increased risk of postmenopausal breast cancer. The underlying mechanisms, however, remain elusive. METHODS: In a nested case-control study of 621 postmenopausal breast cancer case participants and 621 matched control participants, we measured 617 metabolites in prediagnostic serum. We calculated partial Pearson correlations between metabolites and BMI, and then evaluated BMI-associated metabolites (Bonferroni-corrected $\alpha$ level for 617 statistical tests = P {\textless} 8.10 × 10-5) in relation to invasive breast cancer. Odds ratios (ORs) of breast cancer comparing the 90th vs 10th percentile (modeled on a continuous basis) were estimated using conditional logistic regression while controlling for breast cancer risk factors, including BMI. Metabolites with the lowest P values (false discovery rate {\textless} 0.2) were mutually adjusted for one another to determine those independently associated with breast cancer risk. RESULTS: Of 67 BMI-associated metabolites, two were independently associated with invasive breast cancer risk: 16a-hydroxy-DHEA-3-sulfate (OR = 1.65, 95{\%} confidence interval [CI] = 1.22 to 2.22) and 3-methylglutarylcarnitine (OR = 1.67, 95{\%} CI = 1.21 to 2.30). Four metabolites were independently associated with estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer risk: 16a-hydroxy-DHEA-3-sulfate (OR = 1.84, 95{\%} CI = 1.27 to 2.67), 3-methylglutarylcarnitine (OR = 1.91, 95{\%} CI = 1.23 to 2.96), allo-isoleucine (OR = 1.76, 95{\%} CI = 1.23 to 2.51), and 2-methylbutyrylcarnitine (OR = 1.89, 95{\%} CI = 1.22 to 2.91). In a model without metabolites, each 5 kg/m2 increase in BMI was associated with a 14{\%} higher risk of breast cancer (OR = 1.14, 95{\%} CI = 1.01 to 1.28), but adding 16a-hydroxy-DHEA-3-sulfate and 3-methylglutarylcarnitine weakened this association (OR = 1.06, 95{\%} CI = 0.93 to 1.20), with the logOR attenuating by 57.6{\%} (95{\%} CI = 21.8{\%} to 100.0+{\%}). CONCLUSION: These four metabolites may signal metabolic pathways that contribute to breast carcinogenesis and that underlie the association of BMI with increased postmenopausal breast cancer risk. These findings warrant further replication efforts.},

[1] have provided a strong critique of the Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) of body-mass index (BMI), arguing that the GWAS approach for the study of BMI is flawed, and has provided us with few biological insights. They suggest that what is needed instead is a new start, involving GWAS for more complex energy balance related traits. In this invited counter-point, we highlight the substantial advances that have occurred in the obesity field, directly stimulated by the GWAS of BMI. We agree that GWAS for BMI is not perfect, but consider that the best route forward for additional discoveries will likely be to expand the search for common and rare variants linked to BMI and other easily obtained measures of obesity, rather than attempting to perform new, much smaller GWAS for energy balance traits that are complex and expensive to measure. For GWAS in general, we emphasise that the power from increasing the sample size of a crude but easily measured phenotype outweighs the benefits of better phenotyping.},

This widely used adage sums up in a few words the notion that a successful visual representation of a concept should enable easy and rapid absorption of large amounts of information. Although, in general, the notion of capturing complex ideas using images is very appealing, would 1000 words be enough to describe the unknown in a research field such as the life sciences? Life sciences is one of the biggest generators of enormous datasets, mainly as a result of recent and rapid technological advances; their complexity can make these datasets incomprehensible without effective visualization methods. Here we discuss the past, present and future of genomic and systems biology visualization. We briefly comment on many visualization and analysis tools and the purposes that they serve. We focus on the latest libraries and programming languages that enable more effective, efficient and faster approaches for visualizing biological concepts, and also comment on the future human-computer interaction trends that would enable for enhancing visualization further.},

@article{Anette2015,
abstract = {Rationale: Obesity leads to increased ischemic heart disease (IHD) risk, but the risk is thought to be mediated through intermediate variables and may not be caused by increased weight per se. Objective: To test the hypothesis that the increased IHD risk because of obesity is mediated through lipoproteins, blood pressure, glucose, and C-reactive protein. Methods and Results: Approximately 90 000 participants from Copenhagen were included in a Mendelian randomization design with mediation analyses. Associations were examined using conventional measurements of body mass index and intermediate variables and using genetic variants associated with these. During ≤22 years of follow-up 13 945 participants developed IHD. The increased IHD risk caused by obesity was partly mediated through elevated levels of nonfasting remnant cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, through elevated blood pressure, and possibly also through elevated nonfasting glucose levels; however, reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and elevated C-reactive protein levels were not mediators in genetic analyses. The 3 intermediate variables that explained the highest excess risk of IHD from genetically determined obesity were low-density lipoprotein cholesterol with 8{\%}, systolic blood pressure with 7{\%}, and remnant cholesterol with 7{\%} excess risk of IHD. Corresponding observational excess risks using conventional body mass index were 21{\%}, 11{\%}, and 20{\%}, respectively. Conclusions: The increased IHD risk because of obesity was partly mediated through elevated levels of nonfasting remnant and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and through elevated blood pressure. Our results suggest that there may be benefit to gain by reducing levels of these risk factors in obese individuals not able to achieve sustained weight loss.},

The aim of this study was to systematically review the literature and update evidence concerning persistence of childhood overweight. A computerized bibliographical search ? restricted to studies with a prospective or retrospective longitudinal design ? was conducted. Two authors independently extracted data and assessed the methodological quality of the included studies in four dimensions (i) study population and participation rate; (ii) study attrition; (iii) data collection and (iv) data analysis. Conclusions were based on a rating system of three levels of evidence. A total of 25 publications were selected for inclusion in this review. According to a methodological quality assessment, 13 studies were considered to be of high quality. The majority of these high-quality studies were published after 2001, indicating that recently published data, in particular, provide us with reliable information. All included studies consistently report an increased risk of overweight and obese youth becoming overweight adults, suggesting that the likelihood of persistence of overweight into adulthood is moderate for overweight and obese youth. However, predictive values varied considerably. Limiting aspects with respect to generalizability and methodological issues are discussed.},

This prospective cohort study included 390 participants aged {\textgreater}65 years who underwent bioelectrical impedance analysis at baseline and follow-up as a part of the Korean Longitudinal Study on Health and Aging. After a median follow-up period of 5.3 years, BFP was significantly higher than that at the start point (P{\textless}0.05). Participants who had the largest increase in BFP had the highest BMI and waist circumference (WC) (P{\textless}0.001). The highest tertile had the highest white blood cell count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, incidence of rapid progression, and decline in eGFR {\textgreater}25{\%} (P≤0.017, P = 0.025, P = 0.005, respectively). The lowest tertile had the lowest triglyceride and highest high-density lipoprotein levels (P{\textless}0.05). The adjusted decline rate in eGFR was correlated with a change in BFP (P = 0.039), but not with that in BMI or WC. The highest tertile had a 4.875-fold increase in the risk for rapid progression to a decline in eGFR (95{\%} CI: 1.366-17.397) and a 4.931-fold decrease in the risk to a decline in eGFR{\textgreater}25{\%} (95{\%} CI: 1.617-15.037), when compared with the lowest tertile. In subgroup analysis, the incidence of renal outcomes was significantly increased according to the increase in BFP in patients with lower eGFR (P≤0.010). A change in BFP may be associated with inflammation and dyslipidemia development, and longitudinal changes in body fat are related to a decrease in eGFR in the elderly.},

abstract = {Objective: Middle age obesity increases risk for Alzheimer disease (AD). This study evaluated neuropathological changes in morbidly obese patients ranging in age from 21-70 years. Methods: 12 autopsied morbidly obese patients (≥136 kg, BMI 45.3-81.1, 7 male, 5 female, ages 21 - 70), without cognitive impairment, were compared to 10 non-obese controls (52 - 106 kg, BMI 17.4 - 32.5, 8 male, 2 female, ages 29 - 74), and 3ADcontrols (1 male, 2 female, ages 63 - 78). Standard hippocampal sections were stained for Bielschowsky, A$\beta$ (4G8), $\tau$ (AT8), or A$\beta$PP (monoclonal, Pierce) and evaluated using semiquantitative criteria. Results: Obese patients had normal-sized brains, but larger hearts (713 ± 273 vs. 438 ± 71 g, p {\textless} 0.01). Only rare brain lesions were noted in any patients {\textless} 65 years. Obese patients {\textgreater} 65 years showed high levels of all indices, in some cases comparable to those seen in AD. Compared to non-obese, non-AD controls, the differences in $\tau$ and A$\beta$PP expression (but not A$\beta$) were significant (p {\textless} 0.05, Mann- Whitney U-test). Conclusion: Alzheimer-type neuropathological changes were frequent in our small sample of morbidly obese elderly individuals without clinical history of cognitive impairment, approaching those seen in Alzheimer disease for some patients. Such changes were not seen in younger obese patients. These changes may be attributable to comorbid conditions such as congestive heart failure, obstructive sleep apnea, or metabolic lipid abnormalities. {\textcopyright} 2009 Dustri-Verlag Dr. K.

abstract = {Endometrial cancer (EC) is the most frequent gynecological cancer in developed countries. Most EC occurs after menopause and is diagnosed as endometrioid (type I) carcinomas, which exhibit a favorable prognosis. In contrast, non-endometrioid (type II) carcinomas such as serous tumors have a poor prognosis. Our goal was to identify novel blood-based markers associated with EC subtypes and recurrence after surgery in postmenopausal women. Using mass spectrometry-based untargeted metabolomics, we examined preoperative serum metabolites among control women (n = 18) and those with non-recurrent (NR) and recurrent (R) cases of type I endometrioid (n = 24) and type II serous (n = 12) carcinomas. R and NR cases were similar with respect to pathological characteristics, body mass index, and age. A total of 1,592 compounds were analyzed including 14 different lipid classes. When we compared EC cases with controls, 137 metabolites were significantly different. A combination of spermine and isovalerate resulted in an age-adjusted area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC{\textless}sub{\textgreater}adj{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}) of 0.914 (P {\textless} 0.001) for EC detection. The combination of 2-oleoylglycerol and TAG42:2-FA12:0 allowed the distinction of R cases from NR cases with an AUC{\textless}sub{\textgreater}adj{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} of 0.901 (P {\textless} 0.001). Type I R cases were also characterized by much lower levels of bile acids and elevated concentrations of phosphorylated fibrinogen cleavage peptide, whereas type II R cases displayed higher levels of ceramides. The findings from our pilot study provide a detailed metabolomics study of EC and identify putative serum biomarkers for defining clinically relevant risk groups.},

However, 2SMR methods are evolving rapidly and GWAS results are often insufficiently curated, undermining efficient implementation of the approach. We therefore developed MR-Base (http://www.mrbase.org): a platform that integrates a curated database of complete GWAS results (no restrictions according to statistical significance) with an application programming interface, web app and R packages that automate 2SMR. The software includes several sensitivity analyses for assessing the impact of horizontal pleiotropy and other violations of assumptions. The database currently comprises 11 billion single nucleotide polymorphism-trait associations from 1673 GWAS and is updated on a regular basis. Integrating data with software ensures more rigorous application of hypothesis-driven analyses and allows millions of potential causal relationships to be efficiently evaluated in phenome-wide association studies.},

abstract = {Mendelian randomization (MR) is the use of genetic variants associated with an exposure to estimate the causal effect of that exposure on an outcome. Mediation analysis is the method of decomposing the effects of an exposure on an outcome, which act directly, and those that act via mediating variables. These effects are decomposed through the use of multivariable analysis to estimate the causal effects between three types of variables: exposures, mediators, and an outcome. Multivariable MR (MVMR) is a recent extension to MR that uses genetic variants associated with multiple, potentially related exposures to estimate the effect of each exposure on a single outcome. MVMR allows for equivalent analysis to mediation within the MR framework and therefore can also be used to estimate mediation effects. This approach retains the benefits of using genetic instruments for causal inference, such as avoiding bias due to confounding, while allowing for estimation of the different effects required for mediation analysis. This review explains MVMR, what is estimated when one exposure is a mediator of another in an MVMR estimation, and how MR and MVMR can therefore be used to estimate mediated effects. This review then goes on to consider the advantages and limitations of using MR and MVMR to conduct mediation analysis.},

abstract = {The number of people affected by Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is close to half a billion and is on a sharp rise, representing a major and growing public health burden. Given its mild initial symptoms, T2DM is often diagnosed several years after its onset, leaving half of diabetic individuals undiagnosed. While several classical clinical and genetic biomarkers have been identified, improving early diagnosis by exploring other kinds of omics data remains crucial. In this study, we have combined longitudinal data from two population-based cohorts CoLaus and DESIR (comprising in total 493 incident cases vs. 1360 controls) to identify new or confirm previously implicated metabolomic biomarkers predicting T2DM incidence more than 5 years ahead of clinical diagnosis. Our longitudinal data have shown robust evidence for valine, leucine, carnitine and glutamic acid being predictive of future conversion to T2DM. We confirmed the causality of such association for leucine by 2-sample Mendelian randomisation (MR) based on independent data. Our MR approach further identified new metabolites potentially playing a causal role on T2D, including betaine, lysine and mannose. Interestingly, for valine and leucine a strong reverse causal effect was detected, indicating that the genetic predisposition to T2DM may trigger early changes of these metabolites, which appear well-before any clinical symptoms. In addition, our study revealed a reverse causal effect of metabolites such as glutamic acid and alanine. Collectively, these findings indicate that molecular traits linked to the genetic basis of T2DM may be particularly promising early biomarkers.},

abstract = {Mendelian randomization analyses are often performed using summarized data. The causal estimate from a one-sample analysis (in which data are taken from a single data source) with weak instrumental variables is biased in the direction of the observational association between the risk factor and outcome, whereas the estimate from a two-sample analysis (in which data on the risk factor and outcome are taken from non-overlapping datasets) is less biased and any bias is in the direction of the null. When using genetic consortia that have partially overlapping sets of participants, the direction and extent of bias are uncertain. In this paper, we perform simulation studies to investigate the magnitude of bias and Type 1 error rate inflation arising from sample overlap. We consider both a continuous outcome and a case-control setting with a binary outcome. For a continuous outcome, bias due to sample overlap is a linear function of the proportion of overlap between the samples. So, in the case of a null causal effect, if the relative bias of the one-sample instrumental variable estimate is 10{\%} (corresponding to an F parameter of 10), then the relative bias with 50{\%} sample overlap is 5{\%}, and with 30{\%} sample overlap is 3{\%}. In a case-control setting, if risk factor measurements are only included for the control participants, unbiased estimates are obtained even in a one-sample setting. However, if risk factor data on both control and case participants are used, then bias is similar with a binary outcome as with a continuous outcome. Consortia releasing publicly available data on the associations of genetic variants with continuous risk factors should provide estimates that exclude case participants from case-control samples.},

Both overweight (body mass index [BMI], 25-29.9 kg/m2) and obese (BMI, ≥30 kg/m2) persons were more likely to have elevated CRP levels than their normal-weight counterparts (BMI, {\textless}25 kg/m2). After adjustment for potential confounders, including smoking and health status, the odds ratio (OR) for elevated CRP was 2.13 (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 1.56-2.91) for obese men and 6.21 (95{\%} CI, 4.94-7.81) for obese women. In addition, BMI was associated with clinically raised CRP levels in women, with an OR of 4.76 (95{\%} CI, 3.42-6.61) for obese women. Waist-to-hip ratio was positively associated with both elevated and clinically raised CRP levels, independent of BMI. Restricting the analyses to young adults (aged 17-39 years) and excluding smokers, persons with inflammatory disease, cardiovascular disease, or diabetes mellitus and estrogen users did not change the main findings.ConclusionHigher BMI is associated with higher CRP concentrations, even among young adults aged 17 to 39 years. These findings suggest a state of low-grade systemic inflammation in overweight and obese persons.},

Total body fat, expressed as a percentage of body weight (BF{\%}), was assessed using a four-compartment body composition model that does not rely on assumptions known to be age, sex, or ethnicity dependent. Statistically significant age dependencies were observed in the BF{\%}-BMI relations in all four sex and ethnic groups (p values {\textless} 0.05–0.001) with older persons showing a higher BF{\%} compared with younger persons with comparable BMIs. Statistically significant sex effects were also observed in BF{\%}-BMI relations within each ethnic group (p values {\textless} 0.001) after controlling first for age. For an equivalent BMI, women have significantly greater amounts of total body fat than do men throughout the entire adult life span. Ethnicity did not significantly influence the BF{\%}-BMI relation after controlling first for age and sex even though both black women and men had longer appendicular bone lengths relative to stature (p values {\textless} 0.001 and 0.02, respectively) compared with white women and men. Body mass index alone accounted for 25{\%} of between individual differences in body fat percentage for the 706 total subjects; adding age and sex as independent variables to the regression model increased the variance (r2) to 67{\%}. These results suggest that BMI is age and sex dependent when used as an indicator of body fatness, but that it is ethnicity independent in black and white adults.},

abstract = {Finding individual-level data for adequately-powered Mendelian randomization  analyses may be problematic. As publicly-available summarized data on genetic associations with disease outcomes from large consortia are becoming more abundant, use of published data is an attractive analysis strategy for obtaining precise estimates of the causal effects of risk factors on outcomes. We detail the necessary steps for conducting Mendelian randomization investigations using published data, and present novel statistical methods for combining data on the associations of multiple (correlated or uncorrelated) genetic variants with the risk factor and outcome into a single causal effect estimate. A two-sample analysis strategy may be employed, in which evidence on the gene-risk factor and gene-outcome associations are taken from different data sources. These approaches allow the efficient identification of risk factors that are suitable targets for clinical intervention from published data, although the ability to assess the assumptions necessary for causal inference is diminished. Methods and guidance are illustrated using the example of the causal effect of serum calcium levels on fasting glucose concentrations. The estimated causal effect of a 1 standard deviation (0.13 mmol/L) increase in calcium levels on fasting glucose (mM) using a single lead variant from the CASR gene region is 0.044 (95 {\%} credible interval -0.002, 0.100). In contrast, using our method to account for the correlation between variants, the corresponding estimate using 17 genetic variants is 0.022 (95 {\%} credible interval 0.009, 0.035), a more clearly positive causal effect.},

abstract = {It is well recognized that the decrease of adiponectin associated with high-fat diet and lack of exercise accounts for the onset of insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, the metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular disease. Our research efforts have led to the identification of adiponectin receptors, AdipoR1 and AdipoR2, with the former shown to activate AMP kinase in the liver and the latter shown to activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-$\alpha$ signaling thereby increasing fatty acid oxidation. Again, adiponectin upregulates mitochondrial function in the skeletal muscle thereby improving glucose/lipid metabolism and insulin resistance. These findings suggested that activation of adiponectin/AdipoR signaling could represent a viable therapeutic approach to lifestyle-linked diseases associated with prevalent obesity thus contributing to healthy longevity in humans. Indeed, they have led to the successful discovery of AdipoRon, a small-molecule AdipoR-activating compound. Thus far, AdipoRon has been found not only to improve insulin resistance in mice but to prolong their lifespan shortened by high-fat diet. Additionally, our structure-based drug discovery research has led to AdipoR being identified as an entirely novel structure having a zinc iron bound within its seven-transmembrane domain as well as an opposite orientation to that of G protein-coupled receptors. It is expected that increasing insight into AdipoR signaling will facilitate the structure-based optimization of candidate small-molecule AdipoR-activating compounds for human use as well as the development of molecularly targeted and calorie-limiting/exercise-mimicking agents for lifestyle-linked diseases.},

abstract = {Objective: To implement a mendelian randomization (MR) approach to determine whether type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D), fasting glucose, fasting insulin, and body mass index (BMI) are causally associated with specific ischemic stroke subtypes.Methods: MR estimates of the association between each possible risk factor and ischemic stroke subtypes were calculated with inverse-variance weighted (conventional) and weighted median approaches, and MR-Egger regression was used to explore pleiotropy. The number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) used as instrumental variables was 49 for T2D, 36 for fasting glucose, 18 for fasting insulin, and 77 for BMI. Genome-wide association study data of SNP-stroke associations were derived from METASTROKE and the Stroke Genetics Network (n = 18,476 ischemic stroke cases and 37,296 controls).Results: Conventional MR analysis showed associations between genetically predicted T2D and large artery stroke (odds ratio [OR] 1.28, 95{\%} confidence interval [CI] 1.16–1.40, p = 3.3 × 10−7) and small vessel stroke (OR 1.21, 95{\%} CI 1.10–1.33, p = 8.9 × 10−5) but not cardioembolic stroke (OR 1.06, 95{\%} CI 0.97–1.15, p = 0.17). The association of T2D with large artery stroke but not small vessel stroke was consistent in a sensitivity analysis using the weighted median method, and there was no evidence of pleiotropy.

The kin-cohort design can be a useful tool for quickly estimating penetrance from volunteers in a setting in which the mutation prevalence is relatively high.},

abstract = {On the basis of clinical and pathologic criteria, endometrial carcinoma has been distinguished as types I (mainly endometrioid) and II (nonendometrioid). Limited data suggest that these subtypes have different risk factor profiles. The authors prospectively evaluated risk factors for types I (n = 1,312) and II (n = 138) incident endometrial carcinoma among 114,409 women in the National Institutes of Health (NIH)-AARP Diet and Health Study (1995-2006). For individual risk factors, relative risks were estimated with Cox regression by subtype, and P(heterogeneity) was assessed in case-case comparisons with type I as the referent. Stronger relations for type I versus Type II tumors were seen for menopausal hormone therapy use (relative risk (RR) of 1.18 vs. 0.84; P(heterogeneity) = 0.01) and body mass index of ≥30 vs. {\textless}30 kg/m2 (RR of 2.93 vs. 1.83; P(heterogeneity) = 0.001). Stronger relations for type II versus type I tumors were observed for being black versus white (RR of 2.18 vs. 0.66; P(heterogeneity) = 0.0004) and having a family history of breast cancer (RR of 1.93 vs. 0.80; P(heterogeneity) = 0.002). Other risk factor associations were similar by subtype. In conclusion, the authors noted different risk factor associations for Types I and II endometrial carcinomas, supporting the etiologic heterogeneity of these tumors. Because of the limited number of Type II cancers, additional evaluation of risk factors will benefit from consortial efforts.},

This widely used adage sums up in a few words the notion that a successful visual representation of a concept should enable easy and rapid absorption of large amounts of information. Although, in general, the notion of capturing complex ideas using images is very appealing, would 1000 words be enough to describe the unknown in a research field such as the life sciences? Life sciences is one of the biggest generators of enormous datasets, mainly as a result of recent and rapid technological advances; their complexity can make these datasets incomprehensible without effective visualization methods. Here we discuss the past, present and future of genomic and systems biology visualization. We briefly comment on many visualization and analysis tools and the purposes that they serve. We focus on the latest libraries and programming languages that enable more effective, efficient and faster approaches for visualizing biological concepts, and also comment on the future human-computer interaction trends that would enable for enhancing visualization further.},

abstract = {The Tanita body-fat analyser is a novel device to estimate body fat, based on the principles of bioelectrical impedance. It differs from other impedance systems which use surface electrodes in that the subjects stand bare-footed on a metal sole-plate which incorporates the electrodes, hence impedance is measured through the legs and lower trunk. In 104 men and 101 women (16–78 years and BMI 16–41 kg/m2) the mean bias in body-fat mass measured using the Tanita body-fat analyser was 0{\textperiodcentered}8 (2SD 7{\textperiodcentered}9) KG RELATIVE TO A FOUR-COMPARTMENT MODEL. THIS IS COMPARABLE TO THE OTHER PREDICTION TECHNIQUES TESTED (CONVENTIONAL TETRAPOLAR IMPEDANCE -1{\textperiodcentered}3 (2sd 6{\textperiodcentered}9) kg, skinfold thicknesses 0{\textperiodcentered}3 (2sd 7{\textperiodcentered}4) kg, and BMI-based formulas -0{\textperiodcentered}2 (2sd 9{\textperiodcentered}0) kg and -0{\textperiodcentered}6 (2sd 8{\textperiodcentered}5) kg), but the agreement was poorer than for ‘reference' methods to measure body fat (density 0{\textperiodcentered}2 (2sd 3{\textperiodcentered}7) kg, total body water -0{\textperiodcentered}9 (2sd 3{\textperiodcentered}4) kg and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry 0{\textperiodcentered}1 (2sd 5{\textperiodcentered}0) kg). The present paper also describes the derivation of a new prediction equation for the calculation of body composition from the Tanita body-fat analyser. The equation incorporates sex, age, and a log-transformation of height, weight and the measured impedance to predict body fat measured by a four-compartment model. This approach is recommended in the derivation of other prediction equations in body composition analysis. Using this novel prediction equation the residual standard deviations were 4{\textperiodcentered}8 {\%} for men and 3{\textperiodcentered}3 {\%} for women. A similar analysis using data collected with a conventional tetrapolar system yielded residual standard deviations of 4{\textperiodcentered}3 {\%} for men and 3{\textperiodcentered}1 {\%} for women. This demonstrates that the practical simplicity of the novel Tanita method is not associated with a clinically significant decrement in performance relative to a traditional impedance device.},

abstract = {Mendelian randomisation (MR) is a method for establishing causality between a risk factor and an outcome by using genetic variants as instrumental variables. In practice, the association between individual genetic variants and the risk factor is often weak, which may lead to a lack of precision in the MR and even biased MR estimates. Usually, the most significant variant within a genetic region is selected to represent the association with the risk factor, but there is no guarantee that this variant will be causal or that it will capture all of the genetic association within the region. It may be advantageous to use extra variants selected from the same region in the MR. The problem is to decide which variants to select. Rather than selecting a specific set of variants, we investigate the use of Bayesian model averaging (BMA) to average the MR over all possible combinations of genetic variants. Our simulations demonstrate that the BMA version of MR outperforms classical estimation with many dependent variants and performs much better than an MR based on variants selected by penalised regression. In further simulations, we investigate robustness to violations in the model assumptions and demonstrate sensitivity to the inclusion of invalid instruments. The method is illustrated by applying it to an MR of the effect of body mass index on blood pressure using SNPs in the FTO gene.},

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma and CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins have emerged as master regulators of adipogenesis, and recent genome-wide studies have indicated widespread overlap in their transcriptional targets. In addition, new evidence has implicated many other factors as positive and negative regulators of adipocyte development. This review highlights recent advances in the field of adipogenesis, including newly identified determinants of brown adipocytes, the function of which is to burn rather than store energy.

abstract = {Background Evidence from high-income countries shows that higher adiposity results in an adverse lipid profile, but it is unclear whether this association is similar in Sub-Saharan African (SSA) populations. This study aimed to assess the association between total and central adiposity measures and lipid profile in Malawi, exploring differences by sex and area of residence (rural/urban).Methods In this cross-sectional study, data from 12 096 rural and 12 847 urban Malawian residents were used. The associations of body mass index (BMI) and waist to hip ratio (WHR) with fasting lipids (total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) and triglycerides (TG)) were assessed by area and sex.Results After adjusting for potential confounders, higher BMI and WHR were linearly associated with increased TC, LDL-C and TG and reduced HDL-C. BMI was more strongly related to fasting lipids than was WHR. The associations of adiposity with adverse lipid profile were stronger in rural compared with urban residents. For instance, one SD increase in BMI was associated with 0.23 mmol/L (95{\%} CI 0.19 to 0.26) increase in TC in rural women and 0.13 mmol/L (95{\%} CI 0.11 to 0.15) in urban women. Sex differences in the associations between adiposity and lipids were less evident.Conclusions The consistent associations observed of higher adiposity with adverse lipid profiles in men and women living in rural and urban areas of Malawi highlight the emerging adverse cardio-metabolic epidemic in this poor population. Our findings underline the potential utility of BMI in estimating cardiovascular risk and highlight the need for greater investment to understand the long-term health outcomes of obesity and adverse lipid profiles and the extent to which lifestyle changes and treatments effectively prevent and modify adverse cardio-metabolic outcomes.},

We applied the new method in a population-based study of 7603 individuals including 574 who developed incident coronary heart disease (CHD) during 15 years of follow-up, making this the largest quantitative study for HDL-CEC.As estimated by NMR-spectroscopy, a 1-SD higher HDL-CEC was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD (hazards ratio, 0.86; 95{\%}CI, 0.79–0.93, adjusted for traditional risk factors and HDL-C). These findings are consistent with published associations based on in vitro cell assays.These corroborative large-scale findings provide further support for a potential protective role of HDL-CEC in CHD and substantiate this new method and its future applications.},

Obesity causes severe changes in the heart and can induce modifications in cardiac structure and function, predisposing the development of heart failure. However, the mechanisms behind functional heart damage when faced with excess adipose tissue are not completely understood.

It can provide a systematic, global, unbiased, and quantitative assessment of proteins, clarifying molecular based involvement in disease pathophysiology. Such knowledge is essential for shedding light on diagnosis and the development of therapeutic strategies.

This study uses knowledge of blood metabolites previously associated with midlife cognition—a preclinical predictor of AD—to systematically investigate causal associations with later AD status. Given that the pathological changes underlying AD are thought to develop years before clinical manifestations of the disease, developing these findings further could hold special utility in informing early treatment intervention.There are currently no disease-modifying treatments for Alzheimer's disease (AD), and an understanding of preclinical causal biomarkers to help target disease pathogenesis in the earliest phases remains elusive. Here, we investigated whether 19 metabolites previously associated with midlife cognition—a preclinical predictor of AD—translate to later clinical risk, using Mendelian randomization (MR) to tease out AD-specific causal relationships. Summary statistics from the largest genome-wide association studies (GWASs) for AD and metabolites were used to perform bidirectional univariable MR. Bayesian model averaging (BMA) was additionally performed to address high correlation between metabolites and identify metabolite combinations that may be on the AD causal pathway. Univariable MR indicated four extra-large high-density lipoproteins (XL.HDL) on the causal pathway to AD: free cholesterol (XL.HDL.FC: 95{\%} CI = 0.78 to 0.94), total lipids (XL.HDL.L: 95{\%} CI = 0.80 to 0.97), phospholipids (XL.HDL.PL: 95{\%} CI = 0.81 to 0.97), and concentration of XL.HDL particles (95{\%} CI = 0.79 to 0.96), significant at an adjusted P {\&}lt; 0.009. MR–BMA corroborated XL.HDL.FC to be among the top three causal metabolites, in addition to total cholesterol in XL.HDL (XL.HDL.C) and glycoprotein acetyls (GP). Both XL.HDL.C and GP demonstrated suggestive univariable evidence of causality (P {\&}lt; 0.05), and GP successfully replicated within an independent dataset. This study offers insight into the causal relationship between metabolites demonstrating association with midlife cognition and AD. It highlights GP in addition to several XL.HDLs—particularly XL.HDL.FC—as causal candidates warranting further investigation. As AD pathology is thought to develop decades prior to symptom onset, expanding on these findings could inform risk reduction strategies.Metabolite data used within primary analyses are publicly available within the MR-Base catalog (https://www.mrbase.org/).

abstract = {Mendelian randomization is the use of genetic variants as instrumental variables to estimate causal effects of risk factors on outcomes. The total causal effect of a risk factor is the change in the outcome resulting from intervening on the risk factor. This total causal effect may potentially encompass multiple mediating mechanisms. For a proposed mediator, the direct effect of the risk factor is the change in the outcome resulting from a change in the risk factor, keeping the mediator constant. A difference between the total effect and the direct effect indicates that the causal pathway from the risk factor to the outcome acts at least in part via the mediator (an indirect effect). Here, we show that Mendelian randomization estimates of total and direct effects can be obtained using summarized data on genetic associations with the risk factor, mediator, and outcome, potentially from different data sources. We perform simulations to test the validity of this approach when there is unmeasured confounding and/or bidirectional effects between the risk factor and mediator. We illustrate this method using the relationship between age at menarche and risk of breast cancer, with body mass index (BMI) as a potential mediator. We show an inverse direct causal effect of age at menarche on risk of breast cancer (independent of BMI), and a positive indirect effect via BMI. In conclusion, multivariable Mendelian randomization using summarized genetic data provides a rapid and accessible analytic strategy that can be undertaken using publicly available data to better understand causal mechanisms.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Growing evidence suggests that abdominal obesity is a more important risk factor for the prognosis of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases than BMI. Somatic-affective symptoms of depression have also been linked to cardiovascular risk. The relationship between obesity and depression, however, has remained contradictory. Our aim was therefore to relate body mass index (BMI) and different measures for abdominal obesity (waist circumference, WC, waist-to-hip ratio, WHR, waist-to-height ratio, WHtR) to somatic vs. cognitive-affective symptoms of depression. METHODS: In a cross-sectional population based study, data on the first N = 5000 participants enrolled in the Gutenberg Health Study (GHS) are reported. To analyze the relationship between depression and obesity, we computed linear regression models with the anthropometric measure (BMI, WC, WHR, WHtR) as the dependent variable and life style factors, cardiovascular risk factors and psychotropic medications as potential confounders of obesity/depression. RESULTS: We found that only the somatic, but not the cognitive-affective symptoms of depression are consistently positively associated with anthropometric measures of obesity. CONCLUSIONS: We could demonstrate that the somatic-affective symptoms of depression rather than the cognitive-affective symptoms are strongly related to anthropometric measures. This is also true for younger obese starting at the age of 35 years. Our results are in line with previous studies indicating that visceral adipose tissue plays a key role in the relationship between obesity, depression and cardiovascular disease.},

abstract = {Abstract Epidemiological evidence indicates that the association between body weight and breast cancer risk may differ across menopausal status as well as the estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) tumor status. To date, no meta-analysis has been conducted to assess the association between body weight and ER/PR defined breast cancer risk, taking into account menopausal status and study design. We searched MEDLINE for relevant studies published from January 1, 1970 through December 31, 2007. Summarized risk estimates with 95{\%} confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using a random-effects model. The summarized results of 9 cohorts and 22 case-control studies comparing the highest versus the reference categories of relative body weight showed that the risk for ER+PR+ tumors was 20{\%} lower (95{\%} CI = ?30{\%} to ?8{\%}) among premenopausal (2,643 cases) and 82{\%} higher (95{\%} CI = 55?114{\%}) among postmenopausal (5,469 cases) women. The dose-response meta-analysis of ER+PR+ tumors showed that each 5-unit increase in body mass index (BMI, kg/m2) was associated with a 33{\%} increased risk among postmenopausal women (95{\%} CI = 20?48{\%}) and 10{\%} decreased risk among premenopausal women (95{\%} CI = ?18{\%} to ?1{\%}). No associations were observed for ER?PR? or ER+PR? tumors. For discordant tumors ER+PR? (pre) and ER?PR+ (pre/post) the number of cases were too small ({\textless}200) to interpret results. The relation between body weight and breast cancer risk is critically dependent on the tumor's ER/PR status and the woman's menopausal status. Body weight control is the effective strategy for preventing ER+PR+ tumors after menopause. ? 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract = {Bioactive metabolites are central to numerous pathways and disease pathophysiology, yet many bioactive metabolites are still uncharacterized. Here, we quantified bioactive metabolites using untargeted LC-MS plasma metabolomics in two large cohorts (combined N≈9,300) and utilized genome-wide association analysis and Mendelian randomization to uncover genetic loci with roles in bioactive metabolism and prioritize metabolite features for more in-depth characterization. We identified 118 loci associated with levels of 2,319 distinct metabolite features which replicated across cohorts and reached study-wide significance in meta-analysis. Of these loci, 39 were previously not known to be associated with blood metabolites. Loci harboring SLCO1B1 and UGT1A were highly pleiotropic, accounting for {\&}gt;40{\%} of all associations. Two-sample Mendelian randomization found 46 causal effects of 31 metabolite features on at least one of five common diseases. Of these, 15, including leukotriene D4, had protective effects on both coronary heart disease and primary sclerosing cholangitis. We further assessed the association between baseline metabolite features and incident coronary heart disease using 16 years of follow-up health records. This study characterizes the genetic landscape of bioactive metabolite features and their putative causal effects on disease.Competing Interest StatementVS has received honoraria from Novo Nordisk and Sanofi for consultations.

The methodology combines two molecular windows that contain the majority of the metabolic information available by 1H NMR from native serum, e.g. serum lipids, lipoprotein subclasses as well as various low-molecular-weight metabolites. The experimentation is robotics-controlled and fully automated with a capacity of about 150-180 samples in 24 h. To the best of our knowledge, the presented set-up is unique in the sense of experimental high-throughput, cost-effectiveness, and automated multi-metabolic data analyses. As an example, we demonstrate that the NMR data as such reveal associations between systemic metabolic phenotypes and the metabolic syndrome (n = 4407). The high-throughput of up to 50000 serum samples per year is also paving the way for this technology in large-scale clinical and epidemiological studies.

@article{Bastard2006,
abstract = {It now appears that, in most obese patients, obesity is associated with a low-grade inflammation of white adipose tissue (WAT) resulting from chronic activation of the innate immune system and which can subsequently lead to insulin resistance, impaired glucose tolerance and even diabetes. WAT is the physiological site of energy storage as lipids. In addition, it has been more recently recognized as an active participant in numerous physiological and pathophysiological processes. In obesity, WAT is characterized by an increased production and secretion of a wide range of inflammatory molecules including TNF-$\alpha$ and interleukin-6 (IL-6), which may have local effects on WAT physiology but also systemic effects on other organs. Recent data indicate that obese WAT is infiltrated by macrophages, which may be a major source of locally-produced pro-inflammatory cytokines. Interestingly, weight loss is associated with a reduction in the macrophage infiltration of WAT and an improvement of the inflammatory profile of gene expression. Several factors derived not only from adipocytes but also from infiltrated macrophages probably contribute to the pathogenesis of insulin resistance. Most of them are overproduced during obesity, including leptin, TNF-$\alpha$, IL-6 and resistin. Conversely, expression and plasma levels of adiponectin, an insulin-sensitising effector, are down-regulated during obesity. Leptin could modulate TNF-$\alpha$ production and macrophage activation. TNF-$\alpha$ is overproduced in adipose tissue of several rodent models of obesity and has an important role in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance in these species. However, its actual involvement in glucose metabolism disorders in humans remains controversial. IL-6 production by human adipose tissue increases during obesity. It may induce hepatic CRP synthesis and may promote the onset of cardiovascular complications. Both TNF-$\alpha$ and IL-6 can alter insulin sensitivity by triggering different key steps in the insulin signalling pathway. In rodents, resistin can induce insulin resistance, while its implication in the control of insulin sensitivity is still a matter of debate in humans. Adiponectin is highly expressed in WAT, and circulating adiponectin levels are decreased in subjects with obesity-related insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes and coronary heart disease. Adiponectin inhibits liver neoglucogenesis and promotes fatty acid oxidation in skeletal muscle. In addition, adiponectin counteracts the pro-inflammatory effects of TNF-$\alpha$ on the arterial wall and probably protects against the development of arteriosclerosis. In obesity, the pro-inflammatory effects of cytokines through intracellular signalling pathways involve the NF-$\kappa$B and JNK systems. Genetic or pharmacological manipulations of these effectors of the inflammatory response have been shown to modulate insulin sensitivity in different animal models. In humans, it has been suggested that the improved glucose tolerance observed in the presence of thiazolidinediones or statins is likely related to their anti-inflammatory properties. Thus, it can be considered that obesity corresponds to a sub-clinical inflammatory condition that promotes the production of pro-inflammatory factors involved in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance.},

abstract = {Adipose tissue is now recognised as a highly active metabolic and endocrine organ. Great strides have been made in uncovering the multiple functions of the adipocyte in cellular and molecular detail, but it is essential to remember that adipose tissue normally operates as a structured whole. Its functions are regulated by multiple external influences such as autonomic nervous system activity, the rate of blood flow and the delivery of a complex mix of substrates and hormones in the plasma. Attempting to understand how all these factors converge and regulate adipose tissue function is a prime example of integrative physiology. Adipose tissue metabolism is extremely dynamic, and the supply of and removal of substrates in the blood is acutely regulated according to the nutritional state. Adipose tissue possesses the ability to a very large extent to modulate its own metabolic activities, including differentiation of new adipocytes and production of blood vessels as necessary to accommodate increasing fat stores. At the same time, adipocytes signal to other tissues to regulate their energy metabolism in accordance with the body's nutritional state. Ultimately adipocyte fat stores have to match the body's overall surplus or deficit of energy. This implies the existence of one (or more) signal(s) to the adipose tissue that reflects the body's energy status, and points once again to the need for an integrative view of adipose tissue function.},

A common feature of cancer cell metabolism is the ability to acquire necessary nutrients from a frequently nutrient-poor environment and utilize these nutrients to both maintain viability and build new biomass. The alterations in intracellular and extracellular metabolites that can accompany cancer-associated metabolic reprogramming have profound effects on gene expression, cellular differentiation, and the tumor microenvironment. In this Perspective, we have organized known cancer-associated metabolic changes into six hallmarks: (1) deregulated uptake of glucose and amino acids, (2) use of opportunistic modes of nutrient acquisition, (3) use of glycolysis/TCA cycle intermediates for biosynthesis and NADPH production, (4) increased demand for nitrogen, (5) alterations in metabolite-driven gene regulation, and (6) metabolic interactions with the microenvironment. While few tumors display all six hallmarks, most display several. The specific hallmarks exhibited by an individual tumor may ultimately contribute to better tumor classification and aid in directing treatment.},

abstract = {Cellular metabolism is at the foundation of all biological activities. The catabolic processes that support cellular bioenergetics and survival have been well studied. By contrast, how cells alter their metabolism to support anabolic biomass accumulation is less well understood. During the commitment to cell proliferation, extensive metabolic rewiring must occur in order for cells to acquire sufficient nutrients such as glucose, amino acids, lipids and nucleotides, which are necessary to support cell growth and to deal with the redox challenges that arise from the increased metabolic activity associated with anabolic processes. Defining the mechanisms of this metabolic adaptation for cell growth and proliferation is now a major focus of research. Understanding the principles that guide anabolic metabolism may ultimately enhance ways to treat diseases that involve deregulated cell growth and proliferation, such as cancer.},

We explored the prospective role of metabolic risk in eating disorders in a UK cohort (n = 2929 participants), measuring 158 metabolic traits in non-fasting EDTA-plasma by nuclear magnetic resonance. We associated metabolic markers at 7 years (exposure) with risk for anorexia nervosa and binge-eating disorder (outcomes) at 14, 16, and 18 years using logistic regression adjusted for maternal education, child's sex, age, body mass index, and calorie intake at 7 years. Elevated very low-density lipoproteins, triglycerides, apolipoprotein-B/A, and monounsaturated fatty acids ratio were associated with lower odds of anorexia nervosa at age 18, while elevated high-density lipoproteins, docosahexaenoic acid and polyunsaturated fatty acids ratio, and fatty acid unsaturation were associated with higher risk for anorexia nervosa at 18 years. Elevated linoleic acid and n-6 fatty acid ratios were associated with lower odds of binge-eating disorder at 16 years, while elevated saturated fatty acid ratio was associated with higher odds of binge-eating disorder. Most associations had large confidence intervals and showed, for anorexia nervosa, different directions across time points. Overall, our results show some evidence for a role of metabolic factors in eating disorders development in adolescence.},

abstract = {Objective This study aimed to compare the causal effect of overall obesity and abdominal obesity on type 2 diabetes among Chinese Han individuals. Methods The causal relationship of BMI and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) with the risk of glucose deterioration and glycemic traits was compared using two different genetic instruments based on 30 BMI loci and 6 WHR loci with Mendelian randomization (MR) in three prospective cohorts (n?=?6,476). Results Each 1-SD genetically instrumented higher WHR was associated with a 65.7{\%} higher risk of glucose deterioration (95{\%} CI?=?1.069-2.569, P?=?0.024), whereas no significant association of BMI with glucose deterioration was observed. Furthermore, a causal relationship was found only between BMI and homeostatic model assessment ?-cell function (HOMA-B) (??=?0.143, P?=?0.001), and there was a nominal association with Stumvoll second-phase insulin secretion traits (??=?0.074, P?=?0.022). The significance level did not persist in sensitivity analyses, except in the causal estimate of WHR on the Gutt index in MR-Egger (??=??0.379, P?=?0.022) and the causal estimate of BMI on homeostatic model assessment ?-cell function in weighted median MR (??=?0.128, P?=?0.017). Conclusions The data from this study support the potential causal relationship between abdominal obesity and hyperglycemia, which may be driven by aggravated insulin resistance, in contrast with the potential causal relationship between overall obesity and insulin secretion.},

abstract = {The Tanita body-fat analyser is a novel device to estimate body fat, based on the principles of bioelectrical impedance. It differs from other impedance systems which use surface electrodes in that the subjects stand bare-footed on a metal sole-plate which incorporates the electrodes, hence impedance is measured through the legs and lower trunk. In 104 men and 101 women (16–78 years and BMI 16–41 kg/m2) the mean bias in body-fat mass measured using the Tanita body-fat analyser was 0{\textperiodcentered}8 (2SD 7{\textperiodcentered}9) KG RELATIVE TO A FOUR-COMPARTMENT MODEL. THIS IS COMPARABLE TO THE OTHER PREDICTION TECHNIQUES TESTED (CONVENTIONAL TETRAPOLAR IMPEDANCE -1{\textperiodcentered}3 (2sd 6{\textperiodcentered}9) kg, skinfold thicknesses 0{\textperiodcentered}3 (2sd 7{\textperiodcentered}4) kg, and BMI-based formulas -0{\textperiodcentered}2 (2sd 9{\textperiodcentered}0) kg and -0{\textperiodcentered}6 (2sd 8{\textperiodcentered}5) kg), but the agreement was poorer than for ‘reference' methods to measure body fat (density 0{\textperiodcentered}2 (2sd 3{\textperiodcentered}7) kg, total body water -0{\textperiodcentered}9 (2sd 3{\textperiodcentered}4) kg and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry 0{\textperiodcentered}1 (2sd 5{\textperiodcentered}0) kg). The present paper also describes the derivation of a new prediction equation for the calculation of body composition from the Tanita body-fat analyser. The equation incorporates sex, age, and a log-transformation of height, weight and the measured impedance to predict body fat measured by a four-compartment model. This approach is recommended in the derivation of other prediction equations in body composition analysis. Using this novel prediction equation the residual standard deviations were 4{\textperiodcentered}8 {\%} for men and 3{\textperiodcentered}3 {\%} for women. A similar analysis using data collected with a conventional tetrapolar system yielded residual standard deviations of 4{\textperiodcentered}3 {\%} for men and 3{\textperiodcentered}1 {\%} for women. This demonstrates that the practical simplicity of the novel Tanita method is not associated with a clinically significant decrement in performance relative to a traditional impedance device.},

Here, we present a strategy, based on the well-established framework of Mendelian randomization, to interrogate the causal relationships between exposure, DNA methylation and outcome. The two-step approach first uses a genetic proxy for the exposure of interest to assess the causal relationship between exposure and methylation. A second step then utilizes a genetic proxy for DNA methylation to interrogate the causal relationship between DNA methylation and outcome. The rationale, origins, methodology, advantages and limitations of this novel strategy are presented.},

Given this investment, it is the ideal time to start planning strategies to capitalize on the infrastructure being established. An obvious gap in the literature relates to the effective use of metabolomics in large-population studies. Although published reports from population-based studies are beginning to emerge, the number to date remains relatively small. Yet, there is great potential for using metabolomics in population-based studies to evaluate the effects of nutritional, pharmaceutical, and environmental exposures (the "exposome"); conduct risk assessments; predict disease development; and diagnose diseases. Currently, the majority of the metabolomics studies in human populations are in nutrition or nutrition-related fields. This symposium provided a timely venue to highlight the current state-of-science on the use of metabolomics in population-based research. This session provided a forum at which investigators with extensive experience in performing research within large initiatives, multi-investigator grants, and epidemiology consortia could stimulate discussion and ideas for population-based metabolomics research and, in turn, improve knowledge to help devise effective methods of health research.},

However, to date, only a few metabolic studies based on large samples are available. Here, we provide novel and specific information on age-related metabolite concentration changes in human homeostasis. We report results from two population-based studies: the KORA F4 study from Germany as a discovery cohort, with 1038 female and 1124 male participants (32-81 years), and the TwinsUK study as replication, with 724 female participants. Targeted metabolomics of fasting serum samples quantified 131 metabolites by FIA-MS/MS. Among these, 71/34 metabolites were significantly associated with age in women/men (BMI adjusted). We further identified a set of 13 independent metabolites in women (with P values ranging from 4.6 × 10(-04) to 7.8 × 10(-42) , $\alpha$(corr) = 0.004). Eleven of these 13 metabolites were replicated in the TwinsUK study, including seven metabolite concentrations that increased with age (C0, C10:1, C12:1, C18:1, SM C16:1, SM C18:1, and PC aa C28:1), while histidine decreased. These results indicate that metabolic profiles are age dependent and might reflect different aging processes, such as incomplete mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. The use of metabolomics will increase our understanding of aging networks and may lead to discoveries that help enhance healthy aging.},

Over the past decade the HMDB has continued to grow and evolve in response to emerging needs for metabolomics researchers and continuing changes in web standards. This year's update, HMDB 4.0, represents the most significant upgrade to the database in its history. For instance, the number of fully annotated metabolites has increased by nearly threefold, the number of experimental spectra has grown by almost fourfold and the number of illustrated metabolic pathways has grown by a factor of almost 60. Significant improvements have also been made to the HMDB's chemical taxonomy, chemical ontology, spectral viewing, and spectral/text searching tools. A great deal of brand new data has also been added to HMDB 4.0. This includes large quantities of predicted MS/MS and GC-MS reference spectral data as well as predicted (physiologically feasible) metabolite structures to facilitate novel metabolite identification. Additional information on metabolite-SNP interactions and the influence of drugs on metabolite levels (pharmacometabolomics) has also been added.

abstract = {Obesity is considered a principal public health concern and ranked as the fifth foremost reason for death globally. Overweight and obesity are one of the main lifestyle illnesses that leads to further health concerns and contributes to numerous chronic diseases, including cancers, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular diseases. The World Health Organization also predicted that 30{\%} of death in the world will be initiated with lifestyle diseases in 2030 and can be stopped through the suitable identification and addressing of associated risk factors and behavioral involvement policies. Thus, detecting and diagnosing obesity as early as possible is crucial. Therefore, the machine learning approach is a promising solution to early predictions of obesity and the risk of overweight because it can offer quick, immediate, and accurate identification of risk factors and condition likelihoods. The present study conducted a systematic literature review to examine obesity research and machine learning techniques for the prevention and treatment of obesity from 2010 to 2020. Accordingly, 93 papers are identified from the review articles as primary studies from an initial pool of over 700 papers addressing obesity. Consequently, this study initially recognized the significant potential factors that influence and cause adult obesity. Next, the main diseases and health consequences of obesity and overweight are investigated. Ultimately, this study recognized the machine learning methods that can be used for the prediction of obesity. Finally, this study seeks to support decision-makers looking to understand the impact of obesity on health in the general population and identify outcomes that can be used to guide health authorities and public health to further mitigate threats and effectively guide obese people globally.},

In the present study, we have characterized and compared the plasma proteomes of two large independent cohorts of obese and overweight individuals using shotgun mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics. Herein, we showed, in both populations from different continents of about 500 individuals each, the concordance of plasma protein MS measurements in terms of variability, gender-specificity, and age-relationship. Additionally, we replicated several known and new associations between proteins, clinical and molecular variables, such as insulin and glucose concentrations. In conclusion, our MS-based analyses of plasma samples from independent human cohorts proved the practical feasibility and efficiency of a large and unified discovery/replication approach in proteomics, which was also recently coined “rectangular” design.},

abstract = {Objective To evaluate the strength and certainty of the evidence underlying an association between increased adiposity, as assessed by body-mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), or waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) and identify the risk of incident cardiovascular disease (CVD) events or mortalityDesign Umbrella review of systematic reviews and meta-analyses.Data sources Google Scholar, PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and manual screening of retrieved referencesEligibility criteria Systematic reviews or meta-analyses of observational studies and Mendelian randomisation (MR) studies that evaluated the association between various obesity-related indices and the risk of developing CVD and/or mortality due to CVDData synthesis Eleven systematic reviews and 53 meta-analyses that investigated associations between obesity and cardiovascular outcomes were included. Results from recently published cohort studies were also incorporated into the existing meta-analyses to update them with more recent data. Thus, the present study compiled all the relevant evidence accumulated to date, encompassing a total of 488 cohorts and over 30 million participants. MR studies were collected to identify any causal relationship between obesity and various CVD outcomes, and to avoid reverse causality. The degree of obesity was measured with BMI, WC, and WHR. The evidence levels of pooled results were graded into high, moderate, low, and very low according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework.Results An increase in BMI was associated with a higher risk of developing coronary heart disease, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, stroke, hypertension, aortic valve stenosis, pulmonary embolism, and venous thromboembolism; the study results corroborate the casual effect of obesity on the incidence of CVD, except stroke, based on MR studies. The increase in the risk of developing CVD for every 5 kg/m2 increase in BMI ranged from 7{\%} (relative risk [RR], 1.07; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 1.03 to 1.11) for stroke to 49{\%} (RR, 1.49; 95{\%} CI, 1.41 to 1.58) for hypertension. The risk of all-cause mortality and CVD-specific mortality increased with adiposity, which was supported by a high grade of evidence from observational analyses; however, the causal effect of obesity on mortality outcomes was not significant in MR studies.Conclusions Only 15 out of the 53 associations (28{\%}) reported for obesity and CVD outcomes were supported with high evidence levels from observational analyses. Although other reported associations might be valid, various degrees of uncertainty remain. The causal effect of obesity on 9 of the 14 CVD-related outcomes was corroborated by MR studies. As obesity is progressively increasing around the globe and because CVD remains a constant threat to public health, it is necessary to understand the gradient of evidence underlying the association between these two clinical entities. Any weak links in the association and causality discovered in this review should be reinforced with further scientific research, while high-certainty associations with established causality should be reflected in clinical practices and health policies.Systematic review registration PROSPERO CRD42020179469.Section 1 What is already known on this topic- Obesity is progressively increasing worldwide and cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains a continued threat to public health.- Although obesity as a risk factor for various cardiovascular outcomes has been studied for decades, the results from previous studies are heterogeneous, making it difficult for clinicians and policy makers to determine genuine and reliable associations.- The level of evidence underlying the associations between obesity and CVD remains unknown.Section 2: What this study adds- Only 15 of the 53 reported associations (28{\%}) between obesity and CVD outcomes are supported with a high level of evidence. While other associations may be genuine, various degrees of uncertainty remain.- An increase in body-mass index was associated with a higher risk of developing coronary heart disease, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, stroke, hypertension, aortic valve stenosis, pulmonary embolism, and venous thromboembolism; the casual effect of obesity on the incidence of CVD was corroborated by Mendelian randomisation (MR) studies, with the exception of stroke.- The increase in the risk of all-cause mortality and CVD-specific mortality with adiposity was supported by a high grade of evidence in observational analyses, but the causal effect of obesity on mortality outcomes was not significant in MR studies.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Clinical TrialPROSPERO CRD42020179469.Funding StatementThis work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korea government (MSIT) (No. 2019R1A2C4070496).Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:NOT applicable.

abstract = {Metabolomics uses advanced analytical chemistry techniques to enable the high-throughput characterization of metabolites from cells, organs, tissues, or biofluids. The rapid growth in metabolomics is leading to a renewed interest in metabolism and the role that small molecule metabolites play in many biological processes. As a result, traditional views of metabolites as being simply the ?bricks and mortar? of cells or just the fuel for cellular energetics are being upended. Indeed, metabolites appear to have much more varied and far more important roles as signaling molecules, immune modulators, endogenous toxins, and environmental sensors. This review explores how metabolomics is yielding important new insights into a number of important biological and physiological processes. In particular, a major focus is on illustrating how metabolomics and discoveries made through metabolomics are improving our understanding of both normal physiology and the pathophysiology of many diseases. These discoveries are yielding new insights into how metabolites influence organ function, immune function, nutrient sensing, and gut physiology. Collectively, this work is leading to a much more unified and system-wide perspective of biology wherein metabolites, proteins, and genes are understood to interact synergistically to modify the actions and functions of organelles, organs, and organisms.},

Using a novel approach of regressing (272,081) parental lifespans beyond age 40 years on participant genotype in a new large data set (UK Biobank), we here show that common variants near the apolipoprotein E and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit alpha 5 genes are associated with lifespan. The effects are strongly sex and age dependent, with APOE ɛ4 differentially influencing maternal lifespan (P=4.2 × 10(-15), effect -1.24 years of maternal life per imputed risk allele in parent; sex difference, P=0.011), and a locus near CHRNA3/5 differentially affecting paternal lifespan (P=4.8 × 10(-11), effect -0.86 years per allele; sex difference P=0.075). Rare homozygous carriers of the risk alleles at both loci are predicted to have 3.3-3.7 years shorter lives.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Compared with normal weight, obesity might be associated with worse clinical outcomes, including chronic kidney disease. Whether this association is modified by age is not known. We investigated the association of BMI with progressive loss of kidney function and all-cause mortality in US veterans. METHODS: In a national cohort of 3,376,187 US veterans with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of more than 60 mL/min per 1{\textperiodcentered}73 m(2), we assessed the association of BMI in patients of different ages ({\textless}40 years, 40 years to {\textless}50 years, 50 years to {\textless}60 years, 60 years to {\textless}70 years, 70 years to {\textless}80 years, and ≥80 years) with loss of kidney function and with all-cause mortality in logistic regression models and Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for ethnic origin, sex, comorbidities, medications, and baseline eGFR. FINDINGS: 274,764 (8{\textperiodcentered}1{\%}) of 3,376,187 veterans had a rapid decline in kidney function (decrease in slope of {\textgreater}5 mL/min per 1{\textperiodcentered}73 m(2)). The lowest risk for loss of kidney function was noted in patients with BMI of at least 25 kg/m(2) but less than 30 kg/m(2). A generally consistent U-shaped association was noted between BMI and rapid loss of kidney function that was more prominent with increasing age, except in the patients younger than 40 years, in whom BMI did not seem to be predictive of renal function impairment. 672,341 veterans died (28{\textperiodcentered}7 per 1000 patient-years, 95{\%} CI 28{\textperiodcentered}6-28{\textperiodcentered}7) over a median follow-up of 6{\textperiodcentered}8 years (IQR 6{\textperiodcentered}5-7{\textperiodcentered}7). BMI also showed a U-shaped association with mortality, which was similar in all age groups. INTERPRETATION: A BMI of 30 kg/m(2) or more is associated with rapid loss of kidney function in patients with eGFR of at least 60 mL/min per 1{\textperiodcentered}73 m(2), and this association is accentuated in older patients. A BMI of 35 kg/m(2) or more is also associated with high mortality. A BMI of at least 25 kg/m(2) but less than 30 kg/m(2) is associated with the best clinical outcomes.

Lowering of LDL-C levels by statin therapy modestly increases the risk of type 2 diabetes, but it is unknown whether this effect is specific to statins.To investigate the associations of 3 routinely measured lipid fractions with CAD and diabetes through mendelian randomization (MR) using conventional MR and making use of newer approaches, such as multivariate MR and MR-Egger, that address the pleiotropy of genetic instruments where relevant.Published data from genome-wide association studies were used to construct genetic instruments and then applied to investigate associations between lipid fractions and the risk of CAD and diabetes using MR approaches that took into account pleiotropy of genetic instruments. The study was conducted from March 12 to December 31, 2015.Coronary artery disease and diabetes.Genetic instruments composed of 130 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were used for LDL-C (explaining 7.9{\%} of its variance), 140 SNPs for HDL-C (6.6{\%} of variance), and 140 SNPs for TGs (5.9{\%} of variance). A 1-SD genetically instrumented elevation in LDL-C levels (equivalent to 38 mg/dL) and TG levels (equivalent to 89 mg/dL) was associated with higher CAD risk; odds ratios (ORs) were 1.68 (95{\%} CI, 1.51-1.87) for LDL-C and 1.28 (95{\%} CI, 1.13-1.45) for TGs. The corresponding OR for HDL-C (equivalent to a 16-mg/dL increase) was 0.95 (95{\%} CI, 0.85-1.06). All 3 lipid traits were associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes. The ORs were 0.79 (95{\%} CI, 0.71-0.88) for LDL-C and 0.83 (95{\%} CI, 0.76-0.90) for HDL-C per 1-SD elevation. For TG, the MR estimates for diabetes were inconsistent, with MR-Egger giving an OR of 0.83 (95{\%}CI, 0.72-0.95) per 1-SD elevation.Routinely measured lipid fractions exhibit contrasting associations with the risk of CAD and diabetes. Increased LDL-C, HDL-C, and possibly TG levels are associated with a lower risk of diabetes. This information will be relevant to the design of clinical trials of lipid-modifying agents, which should carefully monitor participants for dysglycemia and the incidence of diabetes.},

abstract = {In epidemiological studies it is often necessary to disentangle the pathways that  link an exposure to an outcome. Typically the aim is to identify the total effect of the exposure on the outcome, the effect of the exposure that acts through a given set of mediators of interest (indirect effect) and the effect of the exposure unexplained by those same mediators (direct effect). The traditional approach to mediation analysis is based on adjusting for the mediator in standard regression models to estimate the direct effect. However, several methodological papers have shown that under a number of circumstances this traditional approach may produce flawed conclusions. Through a better understanding of the causal structure of the variables involved in the analysis, with a formal definition of direct and indirect effects in a counterfactual framework, alternative analytical methods have been introduced to improve the validity and interpretation of mediation analysis. In this paper, we review and discuss the impact of the three main sources of potential bias in the traditional approach to mediation analyses: (i) mediator-outcome confounding;(ii) exposure-mediator interaction and (iii) mediator-outcome confounding affected by the exposure. We provide examples and discuss the impact these sources have in terms of bias.},

During this period, 44 of {\~{}}130 metabolites increased 1.5{\~{}}60-fold. Consistently fourteen were previously reported. However, we identified another 30 elevated metabolites, implicating hitherto unrecognized metabolic mechanisms induced by fasting. Metabolites in pentose phosphate pathway are abundant, probably due to demand for antioxidants, NADPH, gluconeogenesis and anabolic metabolism. Global increases of TCA cycle-related compounds reflect enhanced mitochondrial activity in tissues during fasting. Enhanced purine/pyrimidine metabolites support RNA/protein synthesis and transcriptional reprogramming, which is promoted also by some fasting-related metabolites, possibly via epigenetic modulations. Thus diverse, pronounced metabolite increases result from greatly activated catabolism and anabolism stimulated by fasting. Anti-oxidation may be a principal response to fasting.},

Recently obesity in elderly women was associated with greater risk of dementia, white matter ischemic changes, and greater brain atrophy. The purpose of this study was to determine whether body type affects global brain volume, a marker of atrophy, in middle-aged men and women. METHODS: T1-weighted 3D volumetric magnetic resonance imaging was used to assess global brain volume for 114 individuals 40 to 66 years of age (average = 54.2 years; standard deviation = 6.6 years; 43 men and 71 women). Total cerebrospinal fluid and brain volumes were obtained with an automated tissue segmentation algorithm. A regression model was used to determine the effect of age, body mass index (BMI), and other cardiovascular risk factors on brain volume and cognition. RESULTS: Age and BMI were each associated with decreased brain volume. BMI did not predict cognition in this sample; however elevated diastolic blood pressure was associated with poorer episodic learning performance. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that middle-aged obese adults may already be experiencing differentially greater brain atrophy, and may potentially be at greater risk for future cognitive decline.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: In previous studies, obesity (measured according to the body mass index) has correlated inconsistently with the risk of biopsy-measured prostate cancer, and specifically high-grade prostate cancer. This meta-analysis aimed to clarify these correlations. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search of the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases was conducted for relevant studies published through January 2014. The pooled estimates of odds ratios (OR) and confidence intervals (CI) were computed, and the meta-analysis was performed with the STATA software according to a random effects approach. RESULTS: A total of 11 studies that included 29,464 individuals were identified. A 5-kg/m2 increase in body mass index was associated with a 15{\%} (OR, 1.15; 95{\%} CI, 0.98-1.34) higher risk of prostate cancer detection and a 37{\%} (OR, 1.37; 95{\%} CI, 1.19-1.57) higher risk of high-grade prostate cancer detection at biopsy. There were no differences among the results of studies conducted in the USA, Europe or Asia. We also found that studies that had adjusted for prostate-specific antigen levels, digital rectal examination results, and prostate volumes obtained positive significant outcomes (OR, 1.27; 95{\%} CI, 1.12-1.44), whereas studies that did not adjust for the above-mentioned confounding variables obtained negative results (OR, 0.92; 95{\%} CI, 0.68-1.25). Moreover, the positive correlation between body mass index and the detection of both prostate cancer and high-grade diseases tended to be stronger as the number of biopsy cores increased. CONCLUSION: The present meta-analysis demonstrated that a high body mass index correlated positively with prostate cancer detection, especially high-grade prostate cancer detection. The adoption of a modified and possibly more aggressive biopsy strategy was suggested for obese populations.},

An outstanding question is how to use these technologies efficiently to identify genes affecting liability to complex disorders. To achieve this goal, we propose a statistical method that has several optimal properties: It can be used with case control data and yet, like family-based designs, controls for population heterogeneity; it is insensitive to the usual violations of model assumptions, such as cases failing to be strictly independent; and, by using Bayesian outlier methods, it circumvents the need for Bonferroni correction for multiple tests, leading to better performance in many settings while still constraining risk for false positives. The performance of our genomic control method is quite good for plausible effects of liability genes, which bodes well for future genetic analyses of complex disorders.},

The study population consisted of 26,607 participants from the Alberta's Tomorrow Project cohort. Two main measures of body shape and size were examined: i) body mass index (BMI) and ii) waist circumference (WC). Incident cancers were identified via linkage to the Alberta Cancer Registry. Cox proportional hazards models were used. Males and females classified as obese (BMI ≥ 30 kg /m−2) have a 33{\%} and 22{\%} increased risk of all-cancer, respectively, than their normal weight counterparts. Similar all-cancer risk increases are observed for those above sex-specific WC guidelines.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The effect of adolescent overweight on future adult coronary heart  disease (CHD) is not known. METHODS: We estimated the prevalence of obese 35-year-olds in 2020 on the basis of adolescent overweight in 2000 and historical trends regarding overweight adolescents who become obese adults. We then used the CHD Policy Model, a state-transition computer simulation of U.S. residents who are 35 years of age or older, to project the annual excess incidence and prevalence of CHD, the total number of excess CHD events, and excess deaths from both CHD and other causes attributable to obesity from 2020 to 2035. We also modeled the effect of treating obesity-related increases in blood pressure and dyslipidemia. RESULTS: Adolescent overweight is projected to increase the prevalence of obese 35-year-olds in 2020 to a range of 30 to 37{\%} in men and 34 to 44{\%} in women. As a consequence of this increased obesity, an increase in the incidence of CHD and in the total number of CHD events and deaths is projected to occur in young adulthood. The increase is projected to continue in both absolute and relative terms as the population reaches middle age. By 2035, it is estimated that the prevalence of CHD will increase by a range of 5 to 16{\%}, with more than 100,000 excess cases of CHD attributable to the increased obesity. Aggressive treatment with currently available therapies to reverse modifiable obesity-related risk factors would reduce, but not eliminate, the projected increase in the number of CHD events. CONCLUSIONS: Although projections 25 or more years into the future are subject to innumerable uncertainties, extrapolation from current data suggests that adolescent overweight will increase rates of CHD among future young and middle-aged adults, resulting in substantial morbidity and mortality.},

This causal association remains after performing sensitivity analyses relaxing pleiotropy assumptions. The causal effect of height on CAD risk is reduced by 1–3{\%} after adjustment for potential mediators (lipids, blood pressure, glycaemic traits, body mass index, socio-economic status). In contrast, our data suggest that lung function (measured by forced expiratory volume [FEV1] and forced vital capacity [FVC]) is a mediator of the effect of height on CAD.

@article{Maguire2018,
abstract = {Summary The WHO 2016 report indicates that worldwide obesity is rising, with over 600 million people in the obese range (BMI{\textgreater}30). The recommended daily calorie intake for adults is 2000 kcal and 2500 kcal for women and men respectively. The average American consumes 3770 kcal/day and the average person in the UK consumes 3400 kcal/day. With such increased caloric intake, there is an increased load on metabolic pathways, in particular glucose metabolism. Such metabolism requires micronutrients as enzyme co-factors. The recommended daily allowance (RDA) for thiamine is 1.3 mg/day and 0.5 mg thiamine is required to process 1000 kilocalories (kcal). Therefore, despite the appearance of being overfed, there is now increasing evidence that the obese population may nutritionally depleted of essential micronutrients. Thiamine deficiency has been reported to be in the region of 16–47{\%} among patients undergoing bariatric surgery for obesity. Thiamine, in turn, requires magnesium to be in its active form thiamine diphosphate, (TDP). TDP also requires magnesium to achieve activation of TDP dependent enzymes, including transketolase (TK), pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and alpha-keto glutaric acid dehydrogenase (AKGDH), during metabolism of glucose. Thiamine and magnesium therefore play a critical role in glucose metabolism and their deficiency may result in the accumulation of anaerobic metabolites including lactate due to a mismatch between caloric burden and function of thiamine dependent enzymes. It may therefore be postulated that thiamine and magnesium deficiency are under-recognized in obesity and may be important in the progress of obesity and obesity related chronic disease states. The aim of the present systematic review was to examine the role of thiamine dependent enzymes in obesity and obesity related chronic disease states.},

Yet, the underlying molecular mechanisms of colorectal carcinogenesis are not completely understood. Within the “Metabolomic profiles throughout the continuum of colorectal cancer” (MetaboCCC) consortium we analyzed data generated by untargeted, mass spectrometry-based metabolomics using plasma from 88 colorectal cancer patients, 200 patients with high-risk adenomas and 200 patients with low-risk adenomas recruited within the “Colorectal Cancer Study of Austria” (CORSA). Univariate logistic regression models comparing colorectal cancer to adenomas resulted in 442 statistically significant molecular features. Metabolites discriminating colorectal cancer patients from those with adenomas in our dataset included acylcarnitines, caffeine, amino acids, glycerophospholipids, fatty acids, bilirubin, bile acids and bacterial metabolites of tryptophan. The data obtained discovers metabolite profiles reflecting metabolic differences between colorectal cancer and colorectal adenomas and delineates a potentially underlying biological interpretation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The main associations of body-mass index (BMI) with overall and cause-specific mortality can best be assessed by long-term prospective follow-up of large numbers of people. The Prospective Studies Collaboration aimed to investigate these associations by sharing data from many studies. METHODS: Collaborative analyses were undertaken of baseline BMI versus mortality in 57 prospective studies with 894 576 participants, mostly in western Europe and North America (61{\%} [n=541 452] male, mean recruitment age 46 [SD 11] years, median recruitment year 1979 [IQR 1975-85], mean BMI 25 [SD 4] kg/m(2)). The analyses were adjusted for age, sex, smoking status, and study. To limit reverse causality, the first 5 years of follow-up were excluded, leaving 66 552 deaths of known cause during a mean of 8 (SD 6) further years of follow-up (mean age at death 67 [SD 10] years): 30 416 vascular; 2070 diabetic, renal or hepatic; 22 592 neoplastic; 3770 respiratory; 7704 other. FINDINGS: In both sexes, mortality was lowest at about 22.5-25 kg/m(2). Above this range, positive associations were recorded for several specific causes and inverse associations for none, the absolute excess risks for higher BMI and smoking were roughly additive, and each 5 kg/m(2) higher BMI was on average associated with about 30{\%} higher overall mortality (hazard ratio per 5 kg/m(2) [HR] 1.29 [95{\%} CI 1.27-1.32]): 40{\%} for vascular mortality (HR 1.41 [1.37-1.45]); 60-120{\%} for diabetic, renal, and hepatic mortality (HRs 2.16 [1.89-2.46], 1.59 [1.27-1.99], and 1.82 [1.59-2.09], respectively); 10{\%} for neoplastic mortality (HR 1.10 [1.06-1.15]); and 20{\%} for respiratory and for all other mortality (HRs 1.20 [1.07-1.34] and 1.20 [1.16-1.25], respectively). Below the range 22.5-25 kg/m(2), BMI was associated inversely with overall mortality, mainly because of strong inverse associations with respiratory disease and lung cancer. These inverse associations were much stronger for smokers than for non-smokers, despite cigarette consumption per smoker varying little with BMI. INTERPRETATION: Although other anthropometric measures (eg, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio) could well add extra information to BMI, and BMI to them, BMI is in itself a strong predictor of overall mortality both above and below the apparent optimum of about 22.5-25 kg/m(2). The progressive excess mortality above this range is due mainly to vascular disease and is probably largely causal. At 30-35 kg/m(2), median survival is reduced by 2-4 years; at 40-45 kg/m(2), it is reduced by 8-10 years (which is comparable with the effects of smoking). The definite excess mortality below 22.5 kg/m(2) is due mainly to smoking-related diseases, and is not fully explained.},

abstract = {Around 50{\%} of patients with the sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome (SAHS) are not obese: body mass index (BMI) {\textless} 30 kg/m2. We hypothesized that local fat deposition around the upper airway may be different in nonobese patients with SAHS from that in normal subjects with the same body mass. We therefore examined the relationship between indices of general obesity; BMI, neck circumference (NC), and percentage total body fat with neck fat deposition measured by magnetic resonance imaging in three matched subject groups. Nine nonobese, nonsnoring control subjects (BMI, 25 SE 0.7 kg/ m2; NC, 38.1 SE 0.5 cm; age, 37.5 SE 2.5 yr), nine nonobese patients with SAHS (BMI, 25.7 SE 0.4 kg/ m2; NC, 39.8 SE 0.8 cm; age, 40 SE 4.2 yr), and nine obese patients with SAHS matched to the other groups for age (BMI, 34 SE 1.1 kg/m2; NC, 43.9 SE 0.6 cm; age, 40 SE 2.7 yr). Neck volume and fat content were assessed from the hard palate to the vocal cords using T1-weighted images. Percentage total body fat was 30 and 44{\%} greater in nonobese and obese patients with SAHS, respectively, than in control subjects. Neck tissue volume was 10{\%} greater in nonobese and 28{\%} greater in obese patients with SAHS than in control subjects. The percentage of neck tissue volume attributed to fat was 27{\%} greater in nonobese and 67{\%} greater in obese patients with SAHS than in control subjects. The excess fat in both the nonobese and obese patients with SAHS compared with that in control subjects was localized to areas anterolateral to the upper airway, the differences were 52 and 88{\%}, respectively. There were no significant differences between nonobese patients with SAHS and control subjects with respect to fat located in other areas of the neck; obese patients with SAHS had 42{\%} more fat than control subjects (p {\textless} 0.05). We conclude that even relatively nonobese patients with SAHS have excess fat deposition, especially anterolateral to the upper airway when compared with control subjects with the same level of obesity assessed using BMI and NC. This may contribute to their predisposition to SAHS.},

abstract = {To assess the joint relationships among body mass index, menopausal status, and breast cancer according to breast cancer subtype and estrogen-progestin medication use, we conducted a meta-analysis of 89 epidemiologic reports published in English during 1980-2012 identified through a systematic search of bibliographic databases. Pooled analysis yielded a summary risk ratio of 0.78 (95{\%} confidence interval (CI): 0.67, 0.92) for hormone receptor-positive premenopausal breast cancer associated with obesity (body mass index (weight (kg)/height (m)(2)) ≥30 compared with {\textless}25). Obesity was associated with a summary risk ratio of 1.39 (95{\%} CI: 1.14, 1.70) for receptor-positive postmenopausal breast cancer. For receptor-negative breast cancer, the summary risk ratios of 1.06 (95{\%} CI: 0.70, 1.60) and 0.98 (95{\%} CI: 0.78, 1.22) associated with obesity were null for both premenopausal and postmenopausal women, respectively. Elevated postmenopausal breast cancer risk ratios associated with obesity were limited to women who never took estrogen-progestin therapy, with risk ratios of 1.42 (95{\%} CI: 1.30, 1.55) among never users and 1.18 (95{\%} CI: 0.98, 1.42) among users; too few studies were available to examine this relationship according to receptor subtype. Future research is needed to confirm whether obesity is unrelated to receptor-negative breast cancer in populations of postmenopausal women with low prevalence of hormone medication use.},

abstract = {Summary The Avon Longitudinal Study of Children and Parents (ALSPAC) was established to understand how genetic and environmental characteristics influence health and development in parents and children. All pregnant women resident in a defined area in the South West of England, with an expected date of delivery between 1st April 1991 and 31st December 1992, were eligible and 13761 women (contributing 13867 pregnancies) were recruited. These women have been followed over the last 19-22 years and have completed up to 20 questionnaires, have had detailed data abstracted from their medical records and have information on any cancer diagnoses and deaths through record linkage. A follow-up assessment was completed 17-18 years postnatal at which anthropometry, blood pressure, fat, lean and bone mass and carotid intima media thickness were assessed, and a fasting blood sample taken. The second follow-up clinic, which additionally measures cognitive function, physical capability, physical activity (with accelerometer) and wrist bone architecture, is underway and two further assessments with similar measurements will take place over the next 5 years. There is a detailed biobank that includes DNA, with genome-wide data available on {\textgreater}10000, stored serum and plasma taken repeatedly since pregnancy and other samples; a wide range of data on completed biospecimen assays are available. Details of how to access these data are provided in this cohort profile.},

These are based on evidence of transcription in human tissues and homology to earlier annotations in human and other mammals. Here, we reanalyze the evidence used by CHESS, and find that nearly all protein-coding predictions are false positives. We find that 86{\%} overlap transposons marked by RepeatMasker that are known to frequently result in false positive protein-coding predictions. More than half are homologous to only nine Alu-derived primate sequences corresponding to an erroneous and previously withdrawn Pfam protein domain. The entire set shows poor evolutionary conservation and PhyloCSF protein-coding evolutionary signatures indistinguishable from noncoding RNAs, indicating lack of protein-coding constraint. Only four predictions are supported by mass spectrometry evidence, and even those matches are inconclusive. Overall, the new protein-coding predictions are unsupported by any credible experimental or evolutionary evidence of function, result primarily from homology to genes incorrectly classified as protein-coding, and are unlikely to encode functional proteins.},

abstract = {Metabolomic analysis of feces may provide insights on colorectal cancer (CRC) if  assay performance is satisfactory. In lyophilized feces from 48 CRC cases, 102 matched controls, and 48 masked quality control specimens, 1043 small molecules were detected with a commercial platform. Assay reproducibility was good for 527 metabolites [technical intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) {\textgreater}0.7 in quality control specimens], but reproducibility in 6-month paired specimens was lower for the majority of metabolites (within-subject ICC ≤0.5). In the CRC cases and controls, significant differences (false discovery rate ≤0.10) were found for 41 of 1043 fecal metabolites. Direct cancer association was found with three fecal heme-related molecules [covariate-adjusted 90th versus 10th percentile odds ratio (OR) = 17-345], 18 peptides/amino acids (OR = 3-14), palmitoyl-sphingomyelin (OR = 14), mandelate (OR = 3) and p-hydroxy-benzaldehyde (OR = 4). Conversely, cancer association was inverse with acetaminophen metabolites (OR {\textless}0.1), tocopherols (OR = 0.3), sitostanol (OR = 0.2), 3-dehydrocarnitine (OR = 0.4), pterin (OR = 0.3), conjugated-linoleate-18-2N7 (OR = 0.2), N-2-furoyl-glycine (OR = 0.3) and p-aminobenzoate (PABA, OR = 0.2). Correlations suggested an independent role for palmitoyl-sphingomyelin and a central role for PABA (which was stable over 6 months, within-subject ICC 0.67) modulated by p-hydroxy-benzaldehyde. Power calculations based on ICCs indicate that only 45{\%} of metabolites with a true relative risk 5.0 would be found in prospectively collected, prediagnostic specimens from 500 cases and 500 controls. Thus, because fecal metabolites vary over time, very large studies will be needed to reliably detect associations of many metabolites that potentially contribute to CRC.},

abstract = {Energy homeostasis is critical for the survival of species. Therefore, multiple and complex mechanisms have evolved to regulate energy intake and expenditure to maintain body weight. For weight maintenance, not only does energy intake have to match energy expenditure, but also macronutrient intake must balance macronutrient oxidation. However, this equilibrium seems to be particularly difficult to achieve in individuals with low fat oxidation, low energy expenditure, low sympathetic activity or low levels of spontaneous physical activity, as in addition to excess energy intake, all of these factors explain the tendency of some people to gain weight. Additionally, large variability in weight change is observed when energy surplus is imposed experimentally or spontaneously. Clearly, the data suggest a strong genetic influence on body weight regulation implying a normal physiology in an 'obesogenic' environment. In this study, we also review evidence that carbohydrate balance may represent the potential signal that regulates energy homeostasis by impacting energy intake and body weight. Because of the small storage capacity for carbohydrate and its importance for metabolism in many tissues and organs, carbohydrate balance must be maintained at a given level. This drive for balance may in turn cause increased energy intake when consuming a diet high in fat and low in carbohydrate. If sustained over time, such an increase in energy intake cannot be detected by available methods, but may cause meaningful increases in body weight. The concept of metabolic flexibility and its impact on body weight regulation is also presented.},

abstract = {Mendelian randomization (MR) is increasingly used to make causal inferences in a  wide range of fields, from drug development to etiologic studies. Causal inference in MR is possible because of the process of genetic inheritance from parents to offspring. Specifically, at gamete formation and conception, meiosis ensures random allocation to the offspring of one allele from each parent at each locus, and these are unrelated to most of the other inherited genetic variants. To date, most MR studies have used data from unrelated individuals. These studies assume that genotypes are independent of the environment across a sample of unrelated individuals, conditional on covariates. Here we describe potential sources of bias, such as transmission ratio distortion, selection bias, population stratification, dynastic effects and assortative mating that can induce spurious or biased SNP-phenotype associations. We explain how studies of related individuals such as sibling pairs or parent-offspring trios can be used to overcome some of these sources of bias, to provide potentially more reliable evidence regarding causal processes. The increasing availability of data from related individuals in large cohort studies presents an opportunity to both overcome some of these biases and also to evaluate familial environmental effects.},

abstract = {Rationale: Obesity leads to increased ischemic heart disease (IHD) risk, but the risk is thought to be mediated through intermediate variables and may not be caused by increased weight per se. Objective: To test the hypothesis that the increased IHD risk because of obesity is mediated through lipoproteins, blood pressure, glucose, and C-reactive protein. Methods and Results: Approximately 90 000 participants from Copenhagen were included in a Mendelian randomization design with mediation analyses. Associations were examined using conventional measurements of body mass index and intermediate variables and using genetic variants associated with these. During ≤22 years of follow-up 13 945 participants developed IHD. The increased IHD risk caused by obesity was partly mediated through elevated levels of nonfasting remnant cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, through elevated blood pressure, and possibly also through elevated nonfasting glucose levels; however, reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and elevated C-reactive protein levels were not mediators in genetic analyses. The 3 intermediate variables that explained the highest excess risk of IHD from genetically determined obesity were low-density lipoprotein cholesterol with 8{\%}, systolic blood pressure with 7{\%}, and remnant cholesterol with 7{\%} excess risk of IHD. Corresponding observational excess risks using conventional body mass index were 21{\%}, 11{\%}, and 20{\%}, respectively. Conclusions: The increased IHD risk because of obesity was partly mediated through elevated levels of nonfasting remnant and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and through elevated blood pressure. Our results suggest that there may be benefit to gain by reducing levels of these risk factors in obese individuals not able to achieve sustained weight loss.},

abstract = {Objective: To investigate the longitudinal relationship between body mass index (BMI), a major vascular risk factor, and cerebral atrophy, a marker of neurodegeneration, in a population-based sample of middle-aged women. Methods: A representative sample of 290 women born in 1908, 1914, 1918, and 1922 was examined in 1968 to 1969, 1974 to 1975, 1980 to 1981, and 1992 to 1993 as part of the Population Study of Women in G{\"{o}}teborg, Sweden. At each examination, women completed a survey on a variety of health and lifestyle factors and underwent anthropometric, clinical, and neuropsychiatric assessments and blood collection. Atrophy of the temporal, frontal, occipital, and parietal lobes was measured on CT in 1992 when participants were age 70 to 84. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were used to assess the relationship between BMI and brain measures. Results: Women with atrophy of the temporal lobe were, on average, 1.1 to 1.5 kg/m2 higher in BMI at all examinations than women without temporal atrophy (p {\&}lt; 0.05). Multivariate analyses showed that age and BMI were the only significant predictors of temporal atrophy. Risk of temporal atrophy increased 13 to 16{\%} per 1.0-kg/m2 increase in BMI (p {\&}lt; 0.05). There were no associations between BMI and atrophy measured at three other brain locations. Conclusion: Overweight and obesity throughout adult life may contribute to the development of temporal atrophy in women.},

abstract = {Waist-hip ratio (WHR) is a measure of body fat distribution and a predictor of  metabolic consequences independent of overall adiposity. WHR is heritable, but few genetic variants influencing this trait have been identified. We conducted a meta-analysis of 32 genome-wide association studies for WHR adjusted for body mass index (comprising up to 77,167 participants), following up 16 loci in an additional 29 studies (comprising up to 113,636 subjects). We identified 13 new loci in or near RSPO3, VEGFA, TBX15-WARS2, NFE2L3, GRB14, DNM3-PIGC, ITPR2-SSPN, LY86, HOXC13, ADAMTS9, ZNRF3-KREMEN1, NISCH-STAB1 and CPEB4 (P = 1.9 × 10⁻⁹ to P = 1.8 × 10⁻⁴⁰) and the known signal at LYPLAL1. Seven of these loci exhibited marked sexual dimorphism, all with a stronger effect on WHR in women than men (P for sex difference = 1.9 × 10⁻³ to P = 1.2 × 10⁻¹³). These findings provide evidence for multiple loci that modulate body fat distribution independent of overall adiposity and reveal strong gene-by-sex interactions.},

abstract = {Blood is a rich biological sample routinely collected in clinical and epidemiological studies. With advancements in high throughput -omics technology, such as metabolomics, epidemiology can now delve more deeply and comprehensively into biological mechanisms involved in the etiology of diseases. However, the impact of the blood collection tube matrix of samples collected needs to be carefully considered to obtain meaningful biological interpretations and understand how the metabolite signatures are affected by different tube types. In the present study, we investigated whether the metabolic profile of blood collected as serum differed from samples collected as ACD plasma, citrate plasma, EDTA plasma, fluoride plasma, or heparin plasma. We identified and quantified 50 metabolites present in all samples utilizing nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The heparin plasma tubes performed the closest to serum, with only three metabolites showing significant differences, followed by EDTA which significantly differed for five metabolites, and fluoride tubes which differed in eleven of the fifty metabolites. Most of these metabolite differences were due to higher levels of amino acids in serum compared to heparin plasma, EDTA plasma, and fluoride plasma. In contrast, metabolite measurements from ACD and citrate plasma differed significantly for approximately half of the metabolites assessed. These metabolite differences in ACD and citrate plasma were largely due to significant interfering peaks from the anticoagulants themselves. Blood is one of the most banked samples and thus mining and comparing samples between studies requires understanding how the metabolite signature is affected by the different media and different tube types.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The built environment might be associated with development of obesity and related disorders. We examined whether neighbourhood exposure to fast-food outlets and physical activity facilities were associated with adiposity in UK adults. METHODS: We used cross-sectional observational data from UK Biobank. Participants were aged 40-70 years and attended 21 assessment centres between 2006 and 2010. Using linked data on environments around each participant's residential address, we examined whether density of physical activity facilities and proximity to fast-food outlets were associated with waist circumference, body-mass index (BMI), and body fat percentage. We used multilevel linear regression models adjusted for potential confounders, and conducted several sensitivity analyses. FINDINGS: Complete case sample sizes were 401 917 (waist circumference models), 401 435 (BMI), and 395 640 (body fat percentage). Greater density of physical activity facilities within 1000 m of home was independently associated with smaller waist circumference and lower BMI and body fat percentage. Compared with people with no nearby facilities, those with at least six facilities close to home had 1{\textperiodcentered}22 cm smaller waist circumference (95{\%} CI -1{\textperiodcentered}64 to -0{\textperiodcentered}80), 0{\textperiodcentered}57 kg/m(2) lower BMI (-0{\textperiodcentered}74 to -0{\textperiodcentered}39), and 0{\textperiodcentered}81 percentage points lower body fat (-1{\textperiodcentered}03 to -0{\textperiodcentered}59). Living further from a fast-food outlet was weakly associated with waist circumference and BMI, mostly among women. Compared with people living fewer than 500 m from a fast-food outlet, those living at least 2000 m away had 0{\textperiodcentered}26 cm smaller waist circumference (-0{\textperiodcentered}52 to 0{\textperiodcentered}01). INTERPRETATION: This study shows strong associations between high densities of physical activity facilities and lower adiposity for adults in mid-life. We observed weaker associations for access to fast food, but these are likely to be underestimated owing to limitations of the food environment measure. Policy makers should consider interventions aimed at tackling the obesogenic built environment. FUNDING: Commonwealth Scholarship Commission, Wellcome Trust Institutional Strategic Support Fund.},

abstract = {Genetic predictions of height differ among human populations and these differences have been interpreted as evidence of polygenic adaptation. These differences were first detected using SNPs genome-wide significantly associated with height, and shown to grow stronger when large numbers of sub-significant SNPs were included, leading to excitement about the prospect of analyzing large fractions of the genome to detect polygenic adaptation for multiple traits. Previous studies of height have been based on SNP effect size measurements in the GIANT Consortium meta-analysis. Here we repeat the analyses in the UK Biobank, a much more homogeneously designed study. We show that polygenic adaptation signals based on large numbers of SNPs below genome-wide significance are extremely sensitive to biases due to uncorrected population stratification. More generally, our results imply that typical constructions of polygenic scores are sensitive to population stratification and that population-level differences should be interpreted with caution.

The Reviewing Editor's assessment is that all the issues have been addressed (see decision letter).},

abstract = {Neuroticism is a strong predictor for a variety of social and behavioral outcomes, but the etiology is still unknown. Our study aims to provide a comprehensive investigation of causal effects of serum metabolome phenotypes on risk of neuroticism using Mendelian randomization (MR) approaches.Genetic associations with 486 metabolic traits were utilized as exposures, and data from a large genome-wide association study of neuroticism were selected as outcome. For MR analysis, we used the standard inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method for primary MR analysis and 3 additional MR methods (MR-Egger, weighted median, and MR pleiotropy residual sum and outlier) for sensitivity analyses.Our study identified 31 metabolites that might have causal effects on neuroticism. Of the 31 metabolites, uric acid and paraxanthine showed robustly significant association with neuroticism in all MR methods. Using single nucleotide polymorphisms as instrumental variables, a 1-SD increase in uric acid was associated with approximately 30{\%} lower risk of neuroticism (OR: 0.77; 95{\%} CI: 0.62–0.95; PIVW = 0.0145), whereas a 1-SD increase in paraxanthine was associated with a 7{\%} higher risk of neuroticism (OR: 1.07; 95{\%} CI: 1.01–1.12; PIVW = .0145).Our study suggested an increased level of uric acid was associated with lower risk of neuroticism, whereas paraxanthine showed the contrary effect. Our study provided novel insight by combining metabolomics with genomics to help understand the pathogenesis of neuroticism.},

abstract = {Mendelian randomization (MR) has been increasingly used to strengthen causal inference in observational epidemiology. Methodological developments in the field allow detecting and/or adjusting for different potential sources of bias, mainly bias due to horizontal pleiotropy (or "off-target" genetic effects). Another potential source of bias is nonrandom matching between spouses (i.e., assortative mating). In this study, we performed simulations to investigate the bias caused in MR by assortative mating. We found that bias can arise due to either cross-trait assortative mating (i.e., assortment on two phenotypes, such as highly educated women selecting taller men) or single-trait assortative mating (i.e., assortment on a single phenotype), even if the exposure and outcome phenotypes are not the phenotypes under assortment. The simulations also indicate that bias due to assortative mating accumulates over generations and that MR methods robust to horizontal pleiotropy are also affected by this bias. Finally, we show that genetic data from mother-father-offspring trios can be used to detect and correct for this bias.},

Methods Using a prospective design, male (n=551) and female (n=872) participants of the Framingham Heart Study were classified as obese (yes/no), diabetic (yes/no), and the number of diabetes-years was determined by data collected over an 18-year surveillance period. All subjects were free from dementia, stroke, and clinically diagnosed cardiovascular disease up to the time of cognitive testing. Statistical models were adjusted for age, education, occupation, native language, and cardiovascular disease risk factors. Body mass index status (non-obese or obese) and NIDDM status (diabetic/non-diabetic) were related to cognitive performance on multiple cognitive measures. Results Adverse effects of obesity on cognitive performance were observed for men only. Diabetes-years related to poorer cognitive performance, but only when men and women were combined for analyses. Neither diabetes nor diabetes-years by obesity interactions were observed. Conclusions The gender-specific results for obesity, but not for diabetes, suggests that the underlying mechanisms linking them to cognition may be different.},

abstract = {AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Type 2 diabetes risk is associated with low birth weight, rapid weight gain during childhood, and shorter stature and lower circulating IGF-I levels in adults. The largest variations in growth rates occur during the first postnatal years. We hypothesised that early postnatal variations in height and weight gain and IGF-I levels may be associated with risk markers for adult disease. METHODS: We measured the fasting insulin sensitivity (Homeostasis model) and insulin secretion post-oral glucose (insulinogenic index 0-30 min) in 851 normal 8-year-old children from a prospective birth cohort. We examined associations between size at birth, postnatal weight gain and circulating IGF-I levels with insulin sensitivity and secretion at 8 years of age. RESULTS: Fasting insulin sensitivity at 8 years was closely related to current BMI (r= -0.33, p{\textless}0.0005). Lower insulin sensitivity and higher BMI and waist circumference were all predicted by greater weight gain between birth to 3 years of age (all p{\textless}0.0005); lower birth weight was associated with reduced insulin sensitivity only in the highest current BMI tertile ( r=0.17, p=0.006). In contrast, lower insulin secretion was related to smaller size at birth ( p=0.01), independent of postnatal weight gain and insulin sensitivity. Lower insulin secretion was also independently related to shorter stature at 8 years of age relative to parental height ( p=0.047) and with lower plasma IGF-I levels at 5 years of age ( n=252, p=0.004). CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Associations between lower birth weight and insulin resistance may be dependent on rapid weight gain during the early postnatal years. However, irrespective of postnatal weight gain, smaller size at birth, lower IGF-I levels and lower childhood height predicted reduced compensatory insulin secretion.},

We applied abdominal magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy to assess adipose tissue distribution and ectopic fat storage, respectively. Plasma branched-chain amino acids concentrations were related to insulin sensitivity and intrahepatic fat independent from adiposity, age and gender, but not to abdominal adipose tissue or intramyocellular fat. CONCLUSIONS: In weight stable overweight and obese individuals, branched-chain amino acid concentrations are specifically associated with hepatic fat storage and insulin resistance.},

abstract = {The importance of body size versus weight distribution for cancer risk is unclear. We investigated associations between measures of body size and shape and the risk of developing cancer. The study population consisted of 26,607 participants from the Alberta's Tomorrow Project cohort. Two main measures of body shape and size were examined: i) body mass index (BMI) and ii) waist circumference (WC). Incident cancers were identified via linkage to the Alberta Cancer Registry. Cox proportional hazards models were used. Males and females classified as obese (BMI ≥ 30 kg /m−2) have a 33{\%} and 22{\%} increased risk of all-cancer, respectively, than their normal weight counterparts. Similar all-cancer risk increases are observed for those above sex-specific WC guidelines. Mutual adjustment for WC attenuates the association between BMI and all-cancer risk, especially among females. Central adiposity appears to be a stronger predictor of all-cancer risk than body size.},

Leptin, the adipocyte hormone, is well known for its role in the regulation of food intake and energy expenditure. In addition to the regulation of appetite and satiety that recently has attracted much attentions, insight has also been gained into the critical role of leptin in the control of the insulin-glucose axis, peripheral glucose and insulin responsiveness. Since the discovery of leptin, leptin has been taken for its therapeutic potential to obesity and diabetes. Recently, the therapeutic effects of central leptin gene therapy have been reported in insulin-deficient diabetes in obesity animal models such as ob/ob mise, diet-induced obese mice, and insulin-deficient type 1 diabetes mice, and also in patients with inactivating mutations in the leptin gene. Herein, we review the role of leptin in regulating feeding behavior and glucose metabolism and also the therapeutic potential of leptin in obesity and diabetes mellitus.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT Conventional tumor markers are unsuitable for detecting carcinoma at an early stage and lack clinical efficacy and utility. In this study, we attempted to investigate the differences in serum metabolite profiles of gastrointestinal cancers and healthy volunteers using a metabolomic approach and searched for sensitive and specific metabolomic biomarker candidates. Human serum samples were obtained esophageal (n?=?15), gastric (n?=?11), and colorectal (n?=?12) cancer patients and healthy volunteers (n?=?12). A model for evaluating metabolomic biomarker candidates was constructed using multiple classification analysis, and the results were assessed with receiver operating characteristic curves. Among the 58 metabolites, the levels of nine, five and 12 metabolites were significantly changed in the esophageal, gastric and colorectal cancer patients, respectively, compared with the healthy volunteers. Multiple classification analysis revealed that the variations in the levels of malonic acid and l-serine largely contributed to the separation of esophageal cancer; gastric cancer was characterized by changes in the levels of 3-hydroxypropionic acid and pyruvic acid; and l-alanine, glucuronoic lactone and l-glutamine contributed to the separation of colorectal cancer. Our approach revealed that some metabolites are more sensitive for detecting gastrointestinal cancer than conventional biomarkers. Our study supports the potential of metabolomics as an early diagnostic tool for cancer. Copyright ? 2011 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

Five prospective studies, in which formal statistic tests have been made, came out with inconsistent findings: two results were in favour of WC in Mexicans African Americanss, respectively, one result was in favour of BMI in Pima Indians, and no difference was found in the other 2 studies. Among the 11 cross-sectional studies that have formally tested the differences, most found a higher odds ratio or slightly larger area under the ROC curve (AUC) for WC than for BMI. A meta-analysis based on the individual data of the Asian cohorts using a paired homogeneity test showed, however, that there was no difference in odds ratio between BMI and WC in Chinese, Japanese, Indian, Mongolian and Filipino men. In conclusion, all studies included in this review showed that either BMI or WC (WHR) predicted or was associated with type II diabetes independently, regardless of the controversial findings on which of these obesity indicators is better.},

@article{Bowden2015,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The number of Mendelian randomization analyses including large numbers of genetic variants is rapidly increasing. This is due to the proliferation of genome-wide association studies, and the desire to obtain more precise estimates of causal effects. However, some genetic variants may not be valid instrumental variables, in particular due to them having more than one proximal phenotypic correlate (pleiotropy). METHODS: We view Mendelian randomization with multiple instruments as a meta-analysis, and show that bias caused by pleiotropy can be regarded as analogous to small study bias. Causal estimates using each instrument can be displayed visually by a funnel plot to assess potential asymmetry. Egger regression, a tool to detect small study bias in meta-analysis, can be adapted to test for bias from pleiotropy, and the slope coefficient from Egger regression provides an estimate of the causal effect. Under the assumption that the association of each genetic variant with the exposure is independent of the pleiotropic effect of the variant (not via the exposure), Egger's test gives a valid test of the null causal hypothesis and a consistent causal effect estimate even when all the genetic variants are invalid instrumental variables. RESULTS: We illustrate the use of this approach by re-analysing two published Mendelian randomization studies of the causal effect of height on lung function, and the causal effect of blood pressure on coronary artery disease risk. The conservative nature of this approach is illustrated with these examples. CONCLUSIONS: An adaption of Egger regression (which we call MR-Egger) can detect some violations of the standard instrumental variable assumptions, and provide an effect estimate which is not subject to these violations. The approach provides a sensitivity analysis for the robustness of the findings from a Mendelian randomization investigation.},

abstract = {Background Assessing the relationship between lung cancer and metabolic conditions is challenging because of the confounding effect of tobacco. Mendelian randomization (MR), or the use of genetic instrumental variables to assess causality, may help to identify the metabolic drivers of lung cancer. Methods and findings We identified genetic instruments for potential metabolic risk factors and evaluated these in relation to risk using 29,266 lung cancer cases (including 11,273 adenocarcinomas, 7,426 squamous cell and 2,664 small cell cases) and 56,450 controls. The MR risk analysis suggested a causal effect of body mass index (BMI) on lung cancer risk for two of the three major histological subtypes, with evidence of a risk increase for squamous cell carcinoma (odds ratio (OR) [95{\%} confidence interval (CI)] = 1.20 [1.01–1.43] and for small cell lung cancer (OR [95{\%}CI] = 1.52 [1.15–2.00]) for each standard deviation (SD) increase in BMI [4.6 kg/m2]), but not for adenocarcinoma (OR [95{\%}CI] = 0.93 [0.79–1.08]) (Pheterogeneity = 4.3x10-3). Additional analysis using a genetic instrument for BMI showed that each SD increase in BMI increased cigarette consumption by 1.27 cigarettes per day (P = 2.1x10-3), providing novel evidence that a genetic susceptibility to obesity influences smoking patterns. There was also evidence that low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was inversely associated with lung cancer overall risk (OR [95{\%}CI] = 0.90 [0.84–0.97] per SD of 38 mg/dl), while fasting insulin was positively associated (OR [95{\%}CI] = 1.63 [1.25–2.13] per SD of 44.4 pmol/l). Sensitivity analyses including a weighted-median approach and MR-Egger test did not detect other pleiotropic effects biasing the main results. Conclusions Our results are consistent with a causal role of fasting insulin and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in lung cancer etiology, as well as for BMI in squamous cell and small cell carcinoma. The latter relation may be mediated by a previously unrecognized effect of obesity on smoking behavior.},

@article{Ormazabal2018,
abstract = {For many years, cardiovascular disease (CVD) has been the leading cause of death around the world. Often associated with CVD are comorbidities such as obesity, abnormal lipid profiles and insulin resistance. Insulin is a key hormone that functions as a regulator of cellular metabolism in many tissues in the human body. Insulin resistance is defined as a decrease in tissue response to insulin stimulation thus insulin resistance is characterized by defects in uptake and oxidation of glucose, a decrease in glycogen synthesis, and, to a lesser extent, the ability to suppress lipid oxidation. Literature widely suggests that free fatty acids are the predominant substrate used in the adult myocardium for ATP production, however, the cardiac metabolic network is highly flexible and can use other substrates, such as glucose, lactate or amino acids. During insulin resistance, several metabolic alterations induce the development of cardiovascular disease. For instance, insulin resistance can induce an imbalance in glucose metabolism that generates chronic hyperglycemia, which in turn triggers oxidative stress and causes an inflammatory response that leads to cell damage. Insulin resistance can also alter systemic lipid metabolism which then leads to the development of dyslipidemia and the well-known lipid triad: (1) high levels of plasma triglycerides, (2) low levels of high-density lipoprotein, and (3) the appearance of small dense low-density lipoproteins. This triad, along with endothelial dysfunction, which can also be induced by aberrant insulin signaling, contribute to atherosclerotic plaque formation. Regarding the systemic consequences associated with insulin resistance and the metabolic cardiac alterations, it can be concluded that insulin resistance in the myocardium generates damage by at least three different mechanisms: (1) signal transduction alteration, (2) impaired regulation of substrate metabolism, and (3) altered delivery of substrates to the myocardium. The aim of this review is to discuss the mechanisms associated with insulin resistance and the development of CVD. New therapies focused on decreasing insulin resistance may contribute to a decrease in both CVD and atherosclerotic plaque generation.},

abstract = {Background: Circulating blood lipids cause coronary heart disease (CHD). However, the precise way in which one or more lipoprotein lipid-related entities account for this relationship remains unclear. We sought to explore the causal relationships of blood lipid traits with risk of CHD using multivariable Mendelian randomization. Methods: We conducted GWAS of circulating blood lipid traits in UK Biobank (up to n=440,546) for LDL cholesterol, triglycerides and apolipoprotein B to identify lipid-associated SNPs. Using data from CARDIoGRAMplusC4D for CHD (consisting of 60,801 cases and 123,504 controls), we performed univariable and multivariable Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses. Similar analyses were conducted for HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I. Findings: GWAS identified multiple independent SNPs associated at P{\&}lt;5x10-8 for LDL cholesterol (220), apolipoprotein B (n=255), triglycerides (440), HDL cholesterol (534) and apolipoprotein AI (440). Between 56-93{\%} of SNPs identified for each lipid trait had not been previously reported in large-scale GWAS. Almost half (46{\%}) of these SNPs were associated at P{\&}lt;5x10-8 with more than one lipid related trait. Assessed individually using MR, each of LDL cholesterol (OR 1.66 per 1 standard deviation higher trait; 95{\%}CI: 1.49; 1.86; P=2.4x10-19), triglycerides (OR 1.34; 95{\%}CI: 1.25, 1.44; P=9.1x10-16) and apolipoprotein B (OR 1.73; 95{\%}CI: 1.56, 1.91; P=1.5x10-25) had effect estimates consistent with a higher risk of CHD. In multivariable MR, only apolipoprotein B (OR 1.92; 95{\%}CI: 1.31, 2.81; P=7.5x10-4) retained a robust effect with the estimate for LDL cholesterol (OR 0.85; 95{\%}CI: 0.57; 1.27; P=0.44) reversing and that of triglycerides (OR 1.12; 95{\%}CI: 1.02, 1.23; P=0.01) becoming markedly weaker. Individual MR analyses showed a 1-SD higher HDL-C (OR 0.80; 95{\%}CI: 0.75, 0.86; P=1.7x10-10) and apolipoprotein A-I (OR 0.83; 95{\%}CI: 0.77, 0.89; P=1.0x10-6) to lower the risk of CHD but these effect estimates weakened to include the null on accounting for apolipoprotein B. Conclusions: Apolipoprotein B is of fundamental causal relevance in the aetiology of CHD, and underlies the relationship of LDL cholesterol and triglycerides with CHD.Competing Interest StatementBAF reported receiving personal fees from Merck {\&}amp; Co., Amgen, Regeneron, Sanofi, Pfizer, CiVi BioPhama, and KrKA Phamaceuticals, and grants from Merck {\&}amp; Co., Amgen, Novartis and Esperion Therapeutics.

abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Mendelian randomization is a technique for judging the causal impact of a risk factor on an outcome from observational data using genetic variants. Although evidence from Mendelian randomization for the effects of major lipids and lipoproteins on coronary heart disease (CHD) risk has been around for a relatively long time, new data resources and new methodological approaches have given fresh insight into these relationships. The lessons from these analyses are likely to be highly relevant when it comes to lipidomics and the analyses of lipid subspecies whose biology is less well understood. RECENT FINDINGS: Although analyses of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and lipoprotein(a) are unambiguous as there are genetic variants that associate exclusively with these risk factors and have well understood biology, analyses for triglycerides, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) are less clear. For example, a subset of genetic variants having specific associations with HDL-c are not associated with CHD risk, but an allele score including all variants associated with HDL-c does associate with CHD risk. Recently developed methods, such as multivariable Mendelian randomization, Mendelian randomization-Egger, and a weighted median method, suggest that the relationship between HDL-c and CHD risk is null, thus confirming experimental evidence. SUMMARY: Robust methods for Mendelian randomization have important utility for understanding the causal relationships between major lipids and CHD risk, and are likely to play an important role in judging the causal relevance of lipid subspecies and other metabolites measured on high-dimensional phenotyping platforms.},

abstract = {Objective: The aim of this study was to develop and test the validity of a new repeatable method to delimit abdominal areas for follow-up of fat mass (FM) and lean tissue mass (LM) in DEXA examinations. Methods: 37 male volunteers underwent two DEXA examinations. Total body FM and LM measurements and corresponding abdominal measurements in a carefully defined region were calculated from the first scan. After repositioning of the subjects and a second scan, the delimited region was copied and the abdominal tissues re-calculated. Results: The mean LM of the abdominal area was 2.804 kg (SD 0.556), and the mean FM was 1.026 kg (SD 0.537). The intra-class correlation coefficient for the repeated abdominal LM, FM, and LM/FM ratio measurements was 0.99. The mean difference (bias) for the repeated abdominal LM measurements was -13 g (95{\%} confidence interval (CI) -193.0 to 166.8), and for the repeated abdominal FM measurements it was -35 g (95{\%} CI -178.9 to 108.5). Conclusions: The results indicate that regional DEXA is a sensitive method with excellent reproducibility in the measurements of the abdominal fat and lean tissues. The method may serve as a useful tool for evaluation and follow-up of various dietary and training programmes.},

abstract = {Background: Mendelian randomization (MR) studies investigate the effect of genetic variation in levels of an exposure on an outcome, thereby using genetic variation as an instrumental variable (IV). We provide a meta-epidemiological overview of the methodological approaches used in MR studies, and evaluate the discussion of MR assumptions and reporting of statistical methods.Methods: We searched PubMed, Medline, Embase and Web of Science for MR studies up to December 2013. We assessed (i) the MR approach used; (ii) whether the plausibility of MR assumptions was discussed; and (iii) whether the statistical methods used were reported adequately.Results: Of 99 studies using data from one study population, 32 used genetic information as a proxy for the exposure without further estimation, 44 performed a formal IV analysis, 7 compared the observed with the expected genotype-outcome association, and 1 used both the latter two approaches. The 80 studies using data from multiple study populations used many different approaches to combine the data; 52 of these studies used some form of IV analysis; 44{\%} of studies discussed the plausibility of all three MR assumptions in their study. Statistical methods used for IV analysis were insufficiently described in 14{\%} of studies.Conclusions: Most MR studies either use the genotype as a proxy for exposure without further estimation or perform an IV analysis. The discussion of underlying assumptions and reporting of statistical methods for IV analysis are frequently insufficient. Studies using data from multiple study populations are further complicated by the combination of data or estimates. We provide a checklist for the reporting of MR studies.},

abstract = {Insulin resistance, and the compensatory hyperinsulinemia that results, has been linked to a host of defects including glucose intolerance, diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, endothelial dysfunction, impaired fibrinolysis, and subclinical inflammation. Patients with this metabolic syndrome have a markedly increased risk for the development of atherothrombotic cardiovascular disease. The characteristic dyslipidemia of insulin resistance consists of elevated triglyceride and triglyceride-rich lipoprotein levels, low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and increased concentrations of small, dense low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Management of this dyslipidemia typically involves a dual approach. Lifestyle modification is an essential component of any successful treatment plan, but alone is usually insufficient to correct these lipoprotein abnormalities. Medications that diminish insulin resistance and directly alter lipoproteins are also necessary in the majority of cases. Combinations of therapeutic agents are often required to optimize attainment of treatment goals.},

abstract = {Understanding how metabolites are longitudinally influenced by age and sex could facilitate the identification of metabolomic profiles and trajectories that indicate disease risk. We investigated the metabolomics of age and sex using longitudinal plasma samples from the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention (WRAP), a cohort of participants who were dementia free at enrollment. Metabolomic profiles were quantified for 2,344 fasting plasma samples among 1,212 participants, each with up to three study visits. Of 1,097 metabolites tested, 623 (56.8{\%}) were associated with age and 695 (63.4{\%}) with sex after correcting for multiple testing. Approximately twice as many metabolites were associated with age in stratified analyses of women versus men, and 68 metabolite trajectories significantly differed by sex, most notably including sphingolipids, which tended to increase in women and decrease in men with age. Using genome-wide genotyping, we also report the heritabilities of metabolites investigated, which ranged dramatically (0.2-99.2{\%}); however, the median heritability of 36.2{\%} suggests that many metabolites are highly influenced by a complex combination of genomic and environmental influences. These findings offer a more profound description of the aging process and may inform many new hypotheses regarding the role metabolites play in healthy and accelerated aging.},

abstract = {Abstract Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate the heritability of body composition measured by DXA in the Diabetes Heart Study (DHS). Research Methods and Procedures: Participants were 292 women and 262 men (age, 38 to 86 years; BMI, 17 to 57 kg/m2) from 244 families. There were 492 white and 49 African-American sibling pairs. DXA measurements of percentage fat mass (FM), whole body FM, and lean mass (LM), as well as regional measurements of trunk fat mass (TFM) and appendicular lean mass (ALM), were obtained. Heritability of FM, LM, and BMI were estimated using Sequential Oligogenic Linkage Analysis Routines. Results: After adjusting for age, gender, ethnicity, and height, the heritability estimates of various compositional attributes were {\%}FM = 0.64, whole body FM = 0.71, TFM = 0.63, whole body LM = 0.60, ALM = 0.66, and BMI = 0.64 (all p {\textless} 0.0001). Additional adjustment for diabetes status, smoking, dietary intake, and physical activity resulted in only minor changes in the heritability estimates (?2 = 0.63 to 0.72, all p {\textless} 0.0001). Furthermore, heritability of TFM after additional adjustment for whole body FM was significant (?2 = 0.55, p {\textless} 0.0001), and heritability of ALM after additional adjustment for whole body LM was also significant (?2 = 0.51, p {\textless} 0.0001). Discussion: These data suggest that FM and LM measured by DXA are highly heritable and can be effectively used in designing linkage studies to locate genes governing body composition. In addition, regional distribution of FM and LM may be genetically determined.},

This action is compromised by disease states affecting anatomical sites ranging from the cerebral cortex to the alveolar sac. Weakness of the respiratory muscles can dominate the clinical manifestations in the later stages of several primary neurologic and neuromuscular disorders in a manner unique to each disease state. Structural abnormalities of the thoracic cage, such as scoliosis or flail chest, interfere with the action of the respiratory muscles?again in a manner unique to each disease state. The hyperinflation that accompanies diseases of the airways interferes with the ability of the respiratory muscles to generate subatmospheric pressure and it increases the load on the respiratory muscles. Impaired respiratory muscle function is the most severe consequence of several newly described syndromes affecting critically ill patients. Research on the respiratory muscles embraces techniques of molecular biology, integrative physiology, and controlled clinical trials. A detailed understanding of disease states affecting the respiratory muscles is necessary for every physician who practices pulmonary medicine or critical care medicine.},

abstract = {In contrast to normal differentiated cells, which rely primarily on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation to generate the energy needed for cellular processes, most cancer cells instead rely on aerobic glycolysis, a phenomenon termed "the Warburg effect." Aerobic glycolysis is an inefficient way to generate adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP), however, and the advantage it confers to cancer cells has been unclear. Here we propose that the metabolism of cancer cells, and indeed all proliferating cells, is adapted to facilitate the uptake and incorporation of nutrients into the biomass (e.g., nucleotides, amino acids, and lipids) needed to produce a new cell. Supporting this idea are recent studies showing that (i) several signaling pathways implicated in cell proliferation also regulate metabolic pathways that incorporate nutrients into biomass; and that (ii) certain cancer-associated mutations enable cancer cells to acquire and metabolize nutrients in a manner conducive to proliferation rather than efficient ATP production. A better understanding of the mechanistic links between cellular metabolism and growth control may ultimately lead to better treatments for human cancer.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: To date, the scientific literature on socioeconomic correlates and determinants of physical activity behaviours has been dispersed throughout a number of systematic reviews, often focusing on one factor (e.g. education or parental income) in one specific age group (e.g. pre-school children or adults). The aim of this umbrella review is to provide a comprehensive and systematic overview of the scientific literature from previously conducted research by summarising and synthesising the importance and strength of the evidence related to socioeconomic correlates and determinants of PA behaviours across the life course. METHODS: Medline, Embase, ISI Web of Science, Scopus and SPORTDiscus were searched for systematic literature reviews and meta-analyses of observational studies investigating the association between socioeconomic determinants of PA and PA itself (from January 2004 to September 2017). Data extraction evaluated the importance of determinants, strength of evidence, and methodological quality of the selected papers. The full protocol is available from PROSPERO (PROSPERO2014:CRD42015010616). RESULTS: Nineteen reviews were included. Moderate methodological quality emerged. For adults, convincing evidence supports a relationship between PA and socioeconomic status (SES), especially in relation to leisure time (positive relationship) and occupational PA (negative relationship). Conversely, no association between PA and SES or parental SES was found for pre-school, school-aged children and adolescents. CONCLUSIONS: Available evidence on the socioeconomic determinants of PA behaviour across the life course is probable (shows fairly consistent associations) at best. While some evidence is available for adults, less was available for youth. This is mainly due to a limited quantity of primary studies, weak research designs and lack of accuracy in the PA and SES assessment methods employed. Further PA domain specific studies using longitudinal design and clear measures of SES and PA assessment are required.},

Between 37 and 86{\%} of gallstones are cholesterol-rich stones, 2-27{\%} are pigment stones and 4-16{\%} are mixed. Cholesterol-rich gallstones are more common in Europe and North America. This has been attributed to obesity and diets containing a high proportion of refined carbohydrates and fat. Low-calorie diets and rapid weight loss are also associated with cholesterol-rich gallstones. Gallstone disease increases with age. Women have a higher prevalence of gallstones than men, which is attributed to exposure to oestrogen and progesterone. Of those with gallstones, around 1 to 4{\%} will develop symptoms annually. Most patients ({\textgreater} 80{\%}) will remain asymptomatic throughout their lifetime and the likelihood of developing symptoms diminishes with time. Liver function tests and an abdominal ultrasound should be offered to patients with symptoms suggestive of gallstone disease (e.g. abdominal pain, jaundice, fever). They should also be considered in patients with less typical but chronic abdominal or gastrointestinal symptoms. In patients with acute pancreatitis and evidence of ongoing bile duct obstruction and/or cholangitis, endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography and biliary sphincterotomy is recommended within 24-72 hours of the onset of symptoms. Patients with acute cholecystitis should be referred for laparoscopic cholecystectomy.},

A total 1197 non-diabetic German adults aged 45 to 83 years, who participated in baseline of the CARLA study 2002–2006 and had metabolite quantification were selected for this study.

The association of dietary patterns with serum metabolites was calculated by means of linear regression and the influence of the fasting status was considered by including interaction terms with each macro- and micronutrient. Higher self-reported intake of alcohol and lower self-reported intake of organic acids were associated with higher concentrations of acylcarnitines and phosphatidylcholines. Mainly the associations between dietary patterns and acylcarnitines and hexose were altered after including interaction terms, suggesting effect modification by fasting status.

abstract = {Triangulation is the practice of obtaining more reliable answers to research questions through integrating results from several different approaches, where each approach has different key sources of potential bias that are unrelated to each other. With respect to causal questions in aetiological epidemiology, if the results of different approaches all point to the same conclusion, this strengthens confidence in the finding. This is particularly the case when the key sources of bias of some of the approaches would predict that findings would point in opposite directions if they were due to such biases. Where there are inconsistencies, understanding the key sources of bias of each approach can help to identify what further research is required to address the causal question. The aim of this paper is to illustrate how triangulation might be used to improve causal inference in aetiological epidemiology. We propose a minimum set of criteria for use in triangulation in aetiological epidemiology, summarize the key sources of bias of several approaches and describe how these might be integrated within a triangulation framework. We emphasize the importance of being explicit about the expected direction of bias within each approach, whenever this is possible, and seeking to identify approaches that would be expected to bias the true causal effect in different directions. We also note the importance, when comparing results, of taking account of differences in the duration and timing of exposures. We provide three examples to illustrate these points.},

Methods from the causal inference literature to conduct mediation in the presence of exposure-mediator interactions, binary outcomes, binary mediators, and case-control study designs are presented. Sensitivity analysis techniques for unmeasured confounding and measurement error are introduced. Discussion is given to extensions to time-to-event outcomes and multiple mediators.

abstract = {Obesity increases the risk for type 2 diabetes through induction of insulin resistance. Treatment of type 2 diabetes has been limited by little translational knowledge of insulin resistance although there have been several well-documented hypotheses for insulin resistance. In those hypotheses, inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, hyperinsulinemia and lipotoxicity have been the major concepts and have received a lot of attention. Oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, genetic background, aging, fatty liver, hypoxia and lipodystrophy are active subjects in the study of these concepts. However, none of those concepts or views has led to an effective therapy for type 2 diabetes. The reason is that there has been no consensus for a unifying mechanism of insulin resistance. In this review article, literature is critically analyzed and reinterpreted for a new energy-based concept of insulin resistance, in which insulin resistance is a result of energy surplus in cells. The energy surplus signal is mediated by ATP and sensed by adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway. Decreasing ATP level by suppression of production or stimulation of utilization is a promising approach in the treatment of insulin resistance. In support, many of existing insulin sensitizing medicines inhibit ATP production in mitochondria. The effective therapies such as weight loss, exercise, and caloric restriction all reduce ATP in insulin sensitive cells. This new concept provides a unifying cellular and molecular mechanism of insulin resistance in obesity, which may apply to insulin resistance in aging and lipodystrophy.},

abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified thousands of genomic regions affecting complex diseases. The next challenge is to elucidate the causal genes and mechanisms involved. One approach is to use statistical colocalization to assess shared genetic aetiology across multiple related traits (e.g. molecular traits, metabolic pathways and complex diseases) to identify causal pathways, prioritize causal variants and evaluate pleiotropy. We propose HyPrColoc (Hypothesis Prioritisation for multi-trait Colocalization), an efficient deterministic Bayesian algorithm using GWAS summary statistics that can detect colocalization across vast numbers of traits simultaneously (e.g. 100 traits can be jointly analysed in around 1 s). We perform a genome-wide multi-trait colocalization analysis of coronary heart disease (CHD) and fourteen related traits, identifying 43 regions in which CHD colocalized with ≥1 trait, including 5 previously unknown CHD loci. Across the 43 loci, we further integrate gene and protein expression quantitative trait loci to identify candidate causal genes.},

abstract = {Overadjustment is defined inconsistently. This term is meant to describe control  (eg, by regression adjustment, stratification, or restriction) for a variable that either increases net bias or decreases precision without affecting bias. We define overadjustment bias as control for an intermediate variable (or a descending proxy for an intermediate variable) on a causal path from exposure to outcome. We define unnecessary adjustment as control for a variable that does not affect bias of the causal relation between exposure and outcome but may affect its precision. We use causal diagrams and an empirical example (the effect of maternal smoking on neonatal mortality) to illustrate and clarify the definition of overadjustment bias, and to distinguish overadjustment bias from unnecessary adjustment. Using simulations, we quantify the amount of bias associated with overadjustment. Moreover, we show that this bias is based on a different causal structure from confounding or selection biases. Overadjustment bias is not a finite sample bias, while inefficiencies due to control for unnecessary variables are a function of sample size.},

To understand the genetic basis of obesity better, here we conduct a genome-wide association study and Metabochip meta-analysis of body mass index (BMI), a measure commonly used to define obesity and assess adiposity, in up to 339,224 individuals. This analysis identifies 97 BMI-associated loci (P {\textless} 5 [times] 10-8), 56 of which are novel. Five loci demonstrate clear evidence of several independent association signals, and many loci have significant effects on other metabolic phenotypes. The 97 loci account for [sim]2.7{\%} of BMI variation, and genome-wide estimates suggest that common variation accounts for {\textgreater}20{\%} of BMI variation. Pathway analyses provide strong support for a role of the central nervous system in obesity susceptibility and implicate new genes and pathways, including those related to synaptic function, glutamate signalling, insulin secretion/action, energy metabolism, lipid biology and adipogenesis.},

abstract = {Abstract Obesity is a major risk factor for endometrial cancer. Still, the association of obesity-related metabolic factors, such as serum lipids and lipoprotein levels, is unclear. We prospectively examined the association of serum levels of triglycerides, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, non?high-density lipoprotein (non-HDL), and HDL cholesterol with endometrial cancer risk among 31,473 women. During 9 years of follow-up, 100 cases of endometrial cancer were identified by linkage to the Cancer Registry of Norway. There was a positive association of serum triglyceride levels with endometrial cancer risk. Comparing the highest to the lowest quartile of triglycerides, the age-adjusted hazard ratio was 2.34 (95{\%} CI: 1.04?5.28), and further adjustment for body mass index attenuated the association (hazard ratio 1.79, 95{\%} CI: 0.79?4.05). For total serum cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and HDL cholesterol there were no associations with endometrial cancer risk, either without or after adjustment for body mass index. Serum triglyceride levels were positively associated with the risk of endometrial cancer, and some of the association seems to be attributable to obesity. Apart from higher estrogen levels produced in adipose tissue, mechanisms more specifically related to triglycerides may also be involved in endometrial cancer. Further prospective studies on this subject are needed to better understand the association of blood lipids with endometrial cancer risk. ? 2009 UICC},

We aimed to evaluate the breadth and validity of associations between CRP and non-infectious, chronic health outcomes and biomarkers. We conducted an umbrella review of systematic reviews and meta-analyses and a systematic review of Mendelian randomization (MR) studies. PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were systematically searched from inception up to March 2019. Meta-analyses of observational studies and MR studies examining associations between CRP and health outcomes were identified, excluding studies on the diagnostic value of CRP for infections. We found 113 meta-analytic comparisons of observational studies and 196 MR analyses, covering a wide range of outcomes. The overwhelming majority of the meta-analyses of observational studies reported a nominally statistically significant result (95/113, 84.1{\%}); however, the majority of the meta-analyses displayed substantial heterogeneity (47.8{\%}), small study effects (39.8{\%}) or excess significance (41.6{\%}). Only two outcomes, cardiovascular mortality and venous thromboembolism, showed convincing evidence of association with CRP levels. When examining the MR literature, we found MR studies for 53/113 outcomes examined in the observational study meta-analyses but substantial support for a causal association with CRP was not observed for any phenotype. Despite the striking amount of research on CRP, convincing evidence for associations and causal effects is remarkably limited.},

However, some variability in absolute concentrations of metabolites are likely to be observed in these collection tubes matrices. Methods We analyzed 189 metabolites using the same protocol for quantitative targeted metabolomics (LC-MS/MS AbsoluteIDQ p180 Kit Biocrates) in three types of samples, serum, plasma EDTA and citrate, of 80 subjects from the Cooperative Health Research In South Tyrol cohort (40 healthy elderly and 40 healthy young). Results The concentration levels were higher in serum than citrate and EDTA, in particular for amino acids and biogenic amines. The average Pearson's correlation coefficients were however always higher than 0.7 for these two classes of metabolites. We could also demonstrate that blank EDTA vacutainer tubes contain a significant amount of sarcosine. Finally, we compared the metabolome of young people against elderly subjects and found that the highest number of metabolites significantly changing with age was detected in serum. Conclusion Serum samples provide higher sensitivity for biomarker discovery studies. Due to the presence of spurious amount of sarcosine in vacutainer EDTA tubes, plasma EDTA is not suitable for studies requiring accurate quantification of sarcosine.},

We therefore developed a non-targeted metabolomics technology to analyse the serum of pre-treatment CRC patients in order to discover putative metabolic markers associated with CRC. Using tandem-mass spectrometry (MS/MS) high throughput MS technology we evaluated the utility of selected markers and this technology for discriminating between CRC and healthy subjects. METHODS: Biomarker discovery was performed using Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FTICR-MS). Comprehensive metabolic profiles of CRC patients and controls from three independent populations from different continents (USA and Japan; total n = 222) were obtained and the best inter-study biomarkers determined. The structural characterization of these and related markers was performed using liquid chromatography (LC) MS/MS and nuclear magnetic resonance technologies. Clinical utility evaluations were performed using a targeted high-throughput triple-quadrupole multiple reaction monitoring (TQ-MRM) method for three biomarkers in two further independent populations from the USA and Japan (total n = 220). RESULTS: Comprehensive metabolomic analyses revealed significantly reduced levels of 28-36 carbon-containing hydroxylated polyunsaturated ultra long-chain fatty-acids in all three independent cohorts of CRC patient samples relative to controls. Structure elucidation studies on the C28 molecules revealed two families harbouring specifically two or three hydroxyl substitutions and varying degrees of unsaturation. The TQ-MRM method successfully validated the FTICR-MS results in two further independent studies. In total, biomarkers in five independent populations across two continental regions were evaluated (three populations by FTICR-MS and two by TQ-MRM). The resultant receiver-operator characteristic curve AUCs ranged from 0.85 to 0.98 (average = 0.91 +/- 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: A novel comprehensive metabolomics technology was used to identify a systemic metabolic dysregulation comprising previously unknown hydroxylated polyunsaturated ultra-long chain fatty acid metabolites in CRC patients. These metabolites are easily measurable in serum and a decrease in their concentration appears to be highly sensitive and specific for the presence of CRC, regardless of ethnic or geographic background. The measurement of these metabolites may represent an additional tool for the early detection and screening of CRC.},

abstract = {Obesity is an epidemic disease that threatens to inundate health care resources by increasing the incidence of diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, and cancer. These effects of obesity result from two factors: the increased mass of adipose tissue and the increased secretion of pathogenetic products from enlarged fat cells. This concept of the pathogenesis of obesity as a disease allows an easy division of disadvantages of obesity into those produced by the mass of fat and those produced by the metabolic effects of fat cells. In the former category are the social disabilities resulting from the stigma associated with obesity, sleep apnea that results in part from increased parapharyngeal fat deposits, and osteoarthritis resulting from the wear and tear on joints from carrying an increased mass of fat. The second category includes the metabolic factors associated with distant effects of products released from enlarged fat cells. The insulin-resistant state that is so common in obesity probably reflects the effects of increased release of fatty acids from fat cells that are then stored in the liver or muscle. When the secretory capacity of the pancreas is overwhelmed by battling insulin resistance, diabetes develops. The strong association of increased fat, especially visceral fat, with diabetes makes this consequence particularly ominous for health care costs. The release of cytokines, particularly IL-6, from the fat cell may stimulate the proinflammatory state that characterizes obesity. The increased secretion of prothrombin activator inhibitor-1 from fat cells may play a role in the procoagulant state of obesity and, along with changes in endothelial function, may be responsible for the increased risk of cardiovascular disease and hypertension. For cancer, the production of estrogens by the enlarged stromal mass plays a role in the risk for breast cancer. Increased cytokine release may play a role in other forms of proliferative growth. The combined effect of these pathogenetic consequences of increased fat stores is an increased risk of shortened life expectancy.},

abstract = {AIMS: We hypothesized that subjects with a normal body mass index (BMI), but high body fat (BF) content [normal weight obesity (NWO)], have a higher prevalence of cardiometabolic dysregulation and are at higher risk for cardiovascular (CV) mortality. METHODS AND RESULTS: We analysed 6171 subjects {\textgreater}20 years of age from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) and the NHANES III mortality study, whose BMI was within the normal range (18.5-24.9 kg/m(2)), and who underwent a complete evaluation that included body composition assessment, blood measurements, and assessment of CV risk factors. Survival information was available for {\textgreater}99{\%} of the subjects after a median follow-up of 8.8 years. We divided our sample using sex-specific tertiles of BF{\%}. The highest tertile of BF ({\textgreater}23.1{\%} in men and {\textgreater}33.3{\%} in women) was labelled as NWO. When compared with the low BF group, the prevalence of metabolic syndrome in subjects with NWO was four-fold higher (16.6 vs. 4.8{\%}, P {\textless} 0.0001). Subjects with NWO also had higher prevalence of dyslipidaemia, hypertension (men), and CV disease (women). After adjustment, women with NWO showed a significant 2.2-fold increased risk for CV mortality (HR = 2.2; 95{\%} CI, 1.03-4.67) in comparison to the low BF group. CONCLUSION: Normal weight obesity, defined as the combination of normal BMI and high BF content, is associated with a high prevalence of cardiometabolic dysregulation, metabolic syndrome, and CV risk factors. In women, NWO is independently associated with increased risk for CV mortality.},

This association may, in part, be due to an effect of educational attainment on smoking behaviour. In this study, we apply a multivariable Mendelian randomisation design to determine whether the effect of educational attainment on smoking behaviour is due to educational attainment or general cognitive ability. We use individual data from the UK Biobank study (N = 120,050) and summary data from large GWA studies of educational attainment, cognitive ability and smoking behaviour. Our results show that more years of education are associated with a reduced likelihood of smoking that is not due to an effect of general cognitive ability on smoking behaviour. Given the considerable physical harms associated with smoking, the effect of educational attainment on smoking is likely to contribute to the health inequalities associated with differences in educational attainment.},

Obesity is primarily considered to be a disorder of energy balance, and it has recently been suggested that some forms of obesity are associated with chronic low-grade inflammation. The present paper focuses on the current status of our knowledge regarding chronic inflammation, a link between obesity and CVDs, including heart diseases, vascular disease and atherosclerosis. The paper discusses the methods of body fat evaluation in humans, the endocrinology and distribution of adipose tissue in the genders, the pathophysiology of obesity, the relationship among obesity, inflammation, and CVD, and the adipose tissue-derived cytokines known to affect inflammation. Due to space limitations, this paper focuses on C-reactive protein, serum amyloid A, leptin, adiponectin, resistin, visfatin, chemerin, omentin, vaspin, apelin, and retinol binding protein 4 as adipokines.},

We find that major health outcomes appear geographically structured and that coincident structure in health outcomes and genotype data can yield biased associations. Understanding and accounting for this phenomenon will be important when making inference from genotype data in large studies.},

abstract = {Objective: Obesity is one of the common risk factors for developing of endometrial cancer and is negatively associated with its survival, although this result is controversial. Endometrial cancer stages range from stage I, which has better clinical outcomes to stage IV, which has poorer clinical outcomes. Endometrial cancer traditionally divides into type 1 and type 2 dependent on histology which has different clinical outcomes. In this study we investigated whether obesity is associated with the stages of endometrial cancer taking into account subtypes of cancer and menopausal status. Methods: Data on 1,104 women with endometrial cancer were retrospectively collected from the largest women's hospital in China and analysed. Data included age at diagnosis, body mass index (BMI), histology of cancer and menopausal status. Results: The BMI in patients with stage I endometrial cancer was significantly higher than that in patients with stage II or III or IV (p=0.0001). However, there was no statistical difference in BMI between patients with stage II, and stage III endometrial cancer. This negative association was persisted with type 1 and type 2 endometrial cancer (p=0.1989) and premenopausal and post-menopausal status (p=0.4342). In addition, the proportion of over-weight or obese women in type1 endometrial cancer with stage I was not different to type 2 endometrial cancer with stage I. Conclusion: Our data demonstrate that BMI is negatively associated with endometrial cancer in early stage regardless of subtypes of cancer, menopausal status and obesity may be also a potential risk factor for developing type 2 endometrial cancer.},

To increase our understanding of the genetic basis of body fat distribution and its molecular links to cardiometabolic traits, here we conduct genome-wide association meta-analyses of traits related to waist and hip circumferences in up to 224,459 individuals. We identify 49 loci (33 new) associated with waist-to-hip ratio adjusted for body mass index (BMI), and an additional 19 loci newly associated with related waist and hip circumference measures (P {\textless} 5 × 10−8). In total, 20 of the 49 waist-to-hip ratio adjusted for BMI loci show significant sexual dimorphism, 19 of which display a stronger effect in women. The identified loci were enriched for genes expressed in adipose tissue and for putative regulatory elements in adipocytes. Pathway analyses implicated adipogenesis, angiogenesis, transcriptional regulation and insulin resistance as processes affecting fat distribution, providing insight into potential pathophysiological mechanisms.},

Mendelian randomization analysis uses genetic variants to proxy modifiable risk factors and can strengthen causal inference in observational studies. We constructed a genetic instrument comprising 11 single nucleotide polymorphisms robustly (P {\textless} 5 × 10-8) associated with circulating selenium in genome-wide association studies. In a Mendelian randomization analysis of 72 729 men in the PRACTICAL Consortium (44 825 case subjects, 27 904 control subjects), 114 $\mu$g/L higher genetically elevated circulating selenium was not associated with prostate cancer (odds ratio [OR] = 1.01, 95{\%} confidence interval [CI] = 0.89 to 1.13). In concordance with findings from SELECT, selenium was weakly associated with advanced (including high-grade) prostate cancer (OR = 1.21, 95{\%} CI = 0.98 to 1.49) and type 2 diabetes (OR = 1.18, 95{\%} CI = 0.97 to 1.43; in a type 2 diabetes genome-wide association study meta-analysis with up to 49 266 case subjects and 249 906 control subjects). Our Mendelian randomization analyses do not support a role for selenium supplementation in prostate cancer prevention and suggest that supplementation could have adverse effects on risks of advanced prostate cancer and type 2 diabetes.},

abstract = {Abstract Background Mendelian randomisation (MR) designs apply instrumental variable techniques using genetic variants to study causal effects. MR is increasingly used to evaluate the role of maternal exposures during pregnancy on offspring health. Objectives We review the application of MR to prenatal exposures and describe reporting of methodologic challenges in this area. Data sources We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Medline Ovid, Cochrane Central, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. Study selection and data extraction Eligible studies met the following criteria: (a) a maternal pregnancy exposure; (b) an outcome assessed in offspring of the pregnancy; and (c) a genetic variant or score proposed as an instrument or proxy for an exposure. Synthesis We quantified the frequency of reporting of MR conditions stated, techniques used to examine assumption plausibility, and reported limitations. Results Forty-three eligible studies were identified. When discussing challenges or limitations, the most common issues described were known potential biases in the broader MR literature, including population stratification (n = 29), weak instrument bias (n = 18), and certain types of pleiotropy (n = 30). Of 22 studies presenting point estimates for the effect of exposure, four defined their causal estimand. Twenty-four studies discussed issues unique to prenatal MR, including selection on pregnancy (n = 1) and pleiotropy via postnatal exposure (n = 10) or offspring genotype (n = 20). Conclusions Prenatal MR studies frequently discuss issues that affect all MR studies, but rarely discuss problems specific to the prenatal context, including selection on pregnancy and effects of postnatal exposure. Future prenatal MR studies should report and attempt to falsify their assumptions, with particular attention to issues specific to prenatal MR. Further research is needed to evaluate the impacts of biases unique to prenatal MR in practice.},

abstract = {Mendelian randomization (MR) uses genetic variants as instrumental variables to infer whether a risk factor causally affects a health outcome. Meta-analysis has been used historically in MR to combine results from separate epidemiological studies, with each study using a small but select group of genetic variants. In recent years, it has been used to combine genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary data for large numbers of genetic variants. Heterogeneity among the causal estimates obtained from multiple genetic variants points to a possible violation of the necessary instrumental variable assumptions. In this article, we provide a basic introduction to MR and the instrumental variable theory that it relies upon. We then describe how random effects models, meta-regression, and robust regression are being used to test and adjust for heterogeneity in order to improve the rigor of the MR approach.},

abstract = {Motivation Metabolomics is an increasingly common part of health research and there is need for pre-analytical data processing. Researchers typically need to characterize the data and to exclude errors within the context of the intended analysis. While some pre-processing steps are common, there is currently a lack of standardization and reporting transparency for these procedures.Results Here we introduce metaboprep, a standardized data processing workflow to extract and characterize high quality metabolomics data sets. The package extracts data from pre-formed worksheets, provides summary statistics and enables the user to select samples and metabolites for their analysis based on a set of quality metrics. A report summarizing quality metrics and the influence of available batch variables on the data is generated for the purpose of open disclosure.

abstract = {The development of depression may involve a complex interplay of environmental and genetic risk factors. PubMed and PsycInfo databases were searched from inception through August 3, 2017, to identify meta-analyses and Mendelian randomization (MR) studies of environmental risk factors associated with depression. For each eligible meta-analysis, we estimated the summary effect size and its 95{\%} confidence interval (CI) by random-effects modeling, the 95{\%} prediction interval, heterogeneity with I2, and evidence of small-study effects and excess significance bias. Seventy meta-analytic reviews met the eligibility criteria and provided 134 meta-analyses for associations from 1283 primary studies. While 109 associations were nominally significant (P {\textless} 0.05), only 8 met the criteria for convincing evidence and, when limited to prospective studies, convincing evidence was found in 6 (widowhood, physical abuse during childhood, obesity, having 4–5 metabolic risk factors, sexual dysfunction, job strain). In studies in which depression was assessed through a structured diagnostic interview, only associations with widowhood, job strain, and being a Gulf War veteran were supported by convincing evidence. Additionally, 8 MR studies were included and provided no consistent evidence for the causal effects of obesity, smoking, and alcohol consumption. The proportion of variance explained by genetic risk factors was extremely small (0.1–0.4{\%}), which limited the evidence provided by the MR studies. Our findings suggest that despite the large number of putative risk factors investigated in the literature, few associations were supported by robust evidence. The current findings may have clinical and research implications for the early identification of individuals at risk for depression.},

The kin-cohort design uses volunteer probands selected from a population with a relatively high frequency of the mutations of interest. By considering the cancer risk in first-degree relatives of mutation-positive and -negative probands as a weighted average of the risk in carriers and noncarriers, with weights calculated assuming a known mode of inheritance, one can infer the penetrance of the mutations. The estimates of penetrance by age 70 years for three specific mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes common among Ashkenazi Jews for the first occurrence of breast or ovary cancer is 63{\%}.

abstract = {Summary Background The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2017 comparative risk assessment (CRA) is a comprehensive approach to risk factor quantification that offers a useful tool for synthesising evidence on risks and risk–outcome associations. With each annual GBD study, we update the GBD CRA to incorporate improved methods, new risks and risk–outcome pairs, and new data on risk exposure levels and risk–outcome associations. Methods We used the CRA framework developed for previous iterations of GBD to estimate levels and trends in exposure, attributable deaths, and attributable disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), by age group, sex, year, and location for 84 behavioural, environmental and occupational, and metabolic risks or groups of risks from 1990 to 2017. This study included 476 risk–outcome pairs that met the GBD study criteria for convincing or probable evidence of causation. We extracted relative risk and exposure estimates from 46 749 randomised controlled trials, cohort studies, household surveys, census data, satellite data, and other sources. We used statistical models to pool data, adjust for bias, and incorporate covariates. Using the counterfactual scenario of theoretical minimum risk exposure level (TMREL), we estimated the portion of deaths and DALYs that could be attributed to a given risk. We explored the relationship between development and risk exposure by modelling the relationship between the Socio-demographic Index (SDI) and risk-weighted exposure prevalence and estimated expected levels of exposure and risk-attributable burden by SDI. Finally, we explored temporal changes in risk-attributable DALYs by decomposing those changes into six main component drivers of change as follows: (1) population growth; (2) changes in population age structures; (3) changes in exposure to environmental and occupational risks; (4) changes in exposure to behavioural risks; (5) changes in exposure to metabolic risks; and (6) changes due to all other factors, approximated as the risk-deleted death and DALY rates, where the risk-deleted rate is the rate that would be observed had we reduced the exposure levels to the TMREL for all risk factors included in GBD 2017. Findings In 2017, 34{\textperiodcentered}1 million (95{\%} uncertainty interval [UI] 33{\textperiodcentered}3–35{\textperiodcentered}0) deaths and 1{\textperiodcentered}21 billion (1{\textperiodcentered}14–1{\textperiodcentered}28) DALYs were attributable to GBD risk factors. Globally, 61{\textperiodcentered}0{\%} (59{\textperiodcentered}6–62{\textperiodcentered}4) of deaths and 48{\textperiodcentered}3{\%} (46{\textperiodcentered}3–50{\textperiodcentered}2) of DALYs were attributed to the GBD 2017 risk factors. When ranked by risk-attributable DALYs, high systolic blood pressure (SBP) was the leading risk factor, accounting for 10{\textperiodcentered}4 million (9{\textperiodcentered}39–11{\textperiodcentered}5) deaths and 218 million (198–237) DALYs, followed by smoking (7{\textperiodcentered}10 million [6{\textperiodcentered}83–7{\textperiodcentered}37] deaths and 182 million [173–193] DALYs), high fasting plasma glucose (6{\textperiodcentered}53 million [5{\textperiodcentered}23–8{\textperiodcentered}23] deaths and 171 million [144–201] DALYs), high body-mass index (BMI; 4{\textperiodcentered}72 million [2{\textperiodcentered}99–6{\textperiodcentered}70] deaths and 148 million [98{\textperiodcentered}6–202] DALYs), and short gestation for birthweight (1{\textperiodcentered}43 million [1{\textperiodcentered}36–1{\textperiodcentered}51] deaths and 139 million [131–147] DALYs). In total, risk-attributable DALYs declined by 4{\textperiodcentered}9{\%} (3{\textperiodcentered}3–6{\textperiodcentered}5) between 2007 and 2017. In the absence of demographic changes (ie, population growth and ageing), changes in risk exposure and risk-deleted DALYs would have led to a 23{\textperiodcentered}5{\%} decline in DALYs during that period. Conversely, in the absence of changes in risk exposure and risk-deleted DALYs, demographic changes would have led to an 18{\textperiodcentered}6{\%} increase in DALYs during that period. The ratios of observed risk exposure levels to exposure levels expected based on SDI (O/E ratios) increased globally for unsafe drinking water and household air pollution between 1990 and 2017. This result suggests that development is occurring more rapidly than are changes in the underlying risk structure in a population. Conversely, nearly universal declines in O/E ratios for smoking and alcohol use indicate that, for a given SDI, exposure to these risks is declining. In 2017, the leading Level 4 risk factor for age-standardised DALY rates was high SBP in four super-regions: central Europe, eastern Europe, and central Asia; north Africa and Middle East; south Asia; and southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania. The leading risk factor in the high-income super-region was smoking, in Latin America and Caribbean was high BMI, and in sub-Saharan Africa was unsafe sex. O/E ratios for unsafe sex in sub-Saharan Africa were notably high, and those for alcohol use in north Africa and the Middle East were notably low. Interpretation By quantifying levels and trends in exposures to risk factors and the resulting disease burden, this assessment offers insight into where past policy and programme efforts might have been successful and highlights current priorities for public health action. Decreases in behavioural, environmental, and occupational risks have largely offset the effects of population growth and ageing, in relation to trends in absolute burden. Conversely, the combination of increasing metabolic risks and population ageing will probably continue to drive the increasing trends in non-communicable diseases at the global level, which presents both a public health challenge and opportunity. We see considerable spatiotemporal heterogeneity in levels of risk exposure and risk-attributable burden. Although levels of development underlie some of this heterogeneity, O/E ratios show risks for which countries are overperforming or underperforming relative to their level of development. As such, these ratios provide a benchmarking tool to help to focus local decision making. Our findings reinforce the importance of both risk exposure monitoring and epidemiological research to assess causal connections between risks and health outcomes, and they highlight the usefulness of the GBD study in synthesising data to draw comprehensive and robust conclusions that help to inform good policy and strategic health planning.

abstract = {Recent genetic studies have identified some alleles that are associated with higher BMI but lower risk of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease. These "favorable adiposity" alleles are collectively associated with lower insulin levels and higher subcutaneous-to-visceral adipose tissue ratio and may protect from disease through higher adipose storage capacity. We aimed to use data from 164,609 individuals from the UK Biobank and five other studies to replicate associations between a genetic score of 11 favorable adiposity variants and adiposity and risk of disease, to test for interactions between BMI and favorable adiposity genetics, and to test effects separately in men and women. In the UK Biobank, the 50{\%} of individuals carrying the most favorable adiposity alleles had higher BMIs (0.120 kg/m(2) [95{\%} CI 0.066, 0.174]; P = 1E-5) and higher body fat percentage (0.301{\%} [0.230, 0.372]; P = 1E-16) compared with the 50{\%} of individuals carrying the fewest alleles. For a given BMI, the 50{\%} of individuals carrying the most favorable adiposity alleles were at lower risk of type 2 diabetes (odds ratio [OR] 0.837 [0.784, 0.894]; P = 1E-7), hypertension (OR 0.935 [0.911, 0.958]; P = 1E-7), and heart disease (OR 0.921 [0.872, 0.973]; P = 0.003) and had lower blood pressure (systolic -0.859 mmHg [-1.099, -0.618]; P = 3E-12 and diastolic -0.394 mmHg [-0.534, -0.254]; P = 4E-8). In women, these associations could be explained by the observation that the alleles associated with higher BMI but lower risk of disease were also associated with a favorable body fat distribution, with a lower waist-to-hip ratio (-0.004 cm [95{\%} CI -0.005, -0.003] 50{\%} vs. 50{\%}; P = 3E-14), but in men, the favorable adiposity alleles were associated with higher waist circumference (0.454 cm [0.267, 0.641] 50{\%} vs. 50{\%}; P = 2E-6) and higher waist-to-hip ratio (0.0013 [0.0003, 0.0024] 50{\%} vs. 50{\%}; P = 0.01). Results were strengthened when a meta-analysis with five additional studies was conducted. There was no evidence of interaction between a genetic score consisting of known BMI variants and the favorable adiposity genetic score. In conclusion, different molecular mechanisms that lead to higher body fat percentage (with greater subcutaneous storage capacity) can have different impacts on cardiometabolic disease risk. Although higher BMI is associated with higher risk of diseases, better fat storage capacity could reduce the risk.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Migraine is comorbid with obesity. Recent research suggests an association between migraine and adipocytokines, proteins that are predominantly secreted from adipose tissue and which participate in energy homeostasis and inflammatory processes. OBJECTIVES: In this review, we first briefly discuss the association between migraine and obesity and the importance of adipose tissue as a neuroendocrine organ. We then present a systematic review of the extant literature evaluating circulating levels of adiponectin and leptin in those with migraine. METHODS: A search of the PubMed database was conducted using the keywords "migraine," "adiponectin," and "leptin." In addition reference lists of relevant articles were reviewed for possible inclusion. English language studies published between 2005 and 2015 evaluating circulating blood concentration of adiponectin or leptin in those with migraine were included. CONCLUSIONS: While the existing data are suggestive that adipokines may be associated with migraine, substantial study design differences and conflicting results limit definitive conclusions. Future research utilizing carefully considered designs and methodology is warranted. In particular careful and systematic characterization of pain states at the time of samples, as well as systematic consideration of demographic (e.g., age, sex) and other vital covariates (e.g., obesity status, lipids) are needed to determine if adipokines play a role in migraine pathophysiology and if any adipokine represents a viable, novel migraine biomarker, or drug target.},

abstract = {Background: Mendelian randomization (MR) studies investigate the effect of genetic variation in levels of an exposure on an outcome, thereby using genetic variation as an instrumental variable (IV). We provide a meta-epidemiological overview of the methodological approaches used in MR studies, and evaluate the discussion of MR assumptions and reporting of statistical methods.Methods: We searched PubMed, Medline, Embase and Web of Science for MR studies up to December 2013. We assessed (i) the MR approach used; (ii) whether the plausibility of MR assumptions was discussed; and (iii) whether the statistical methods used were reported adequately.Results: Of 99 studies using data from one study population, 32 used genetic information as a proxy for the exposure without further estimation, 44 performed a formal IV analysis, 7 compared the observed with the expected genotype-outcome association, and 1 used both the latter two approaches. The 80 studies using data from multiple study populations used many different approaches to combine the data; 52 of these studies used some form of IV analysis; 44{\%} of studies discussed the plausibility of all three MR assumptions in their study. Statistical methods used for IV analysis were insufficiently described in 14{\%} of studies.Conclusions: Most MR studies either use the genotype as a proxy for exposure without further estimation or perform an IV analysis. The discussion of underlying assumptions and reporting of statistical methods for IV analysis are frequently insufficient. Studies using data from multiple study populations are further complicated by the combination of data or estimates. We provide a checklist for the reporting of MR studies.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to identify metabolites associated with BMI and  waist circumference (WC) in women and to determine whether these metabolites are associated with biomarkers of metabolic health. METHODS: Untargeted metabolomic analysis was done on serum from 1,534 women. Metabolites associated with BMI and WC were identified using linear regression with a Bonferroni-corrected P value. Clustered blocks of these metabolites were then defined whose association with the anthropometric measures could be represented by a single metabolite. The association of these representative metabolites with biomarkers for diabetes and inflammation was then determined. RESULTS: About one-third of 781 metabolites included in the analyses were associated with BMI and/or WC. Associations were found for some novel metabolites, including several sphingolipids, nucleotides, and modified fatty acids. Among metabolites most strongly inversely associated with BMI, the choline-containing plasmalogen (O-16:0/18:1) ($\beta$ = -0.30, P = 6.62 × 10(-32) ) was also inversely associated with c-peptide and positively associated with adiponectin. Adjustment for BMI attenuated the metabolite-biomarker associations more for hemoglobin A1c ({\textgreater} 100{\%}) and c-peptide (58.8{\%} to {\textgreater} 100{\%}) than for C-reactive protein (10.5{\%}-40.0{\%}) and adiponectin (7.0{\%}-30.4{\%}). CONCLUSIONS: These results add to the list of metabolites associated with adiposity and indicate that some may influence processes that contribute to the development of obesity-related diseases.},

abstract = {Abstract Background Mendelian randomisation (MR) designs apply instrumental variable techniques using genetic variants to study causal effects. MR is increasingly used to evaluate the role of maternal exposures during pregnancy on offspring health. Objectives We review the application of MR to prenatal exposures and describe reporting of methodologic challenges in this area. Data sources We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Medline Ovid, Cochrane Central, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. Study selection and data extraction Eligible studies met the following criteria: (a) a maternal pregnancy exposure; (b) an outcome assessed in offspring of the pregnancy; and (c) a genetic variant or score proposed as an instrument or proxy for an exposure. Synthesis We quantified the frequency of reporting of MR conditions stated, techniques used to examine assumption plausibility, and reported limitations. Results Forty-three eligible studies were identified. When discussing challenges or limitations, the most common issues described were known potential biases in the broader MR literature, including population stratification (n = 29), weak instrument bias (n = 18), and certain types of pleiotropy (n = 30). Of 22 studies presenting point estimates for the effect of exposure, four defined their causal estimand. Twenty-four studies discussed issues unique to prenatal MR, including selection on pregnancy (n = 1) and pleiotropy via postnatal exposure (n = 10) or offspring genotype (n = 20). Conclusions Prenatal MR studies frequently discuss issues that affect all MR studies, but rarely discuss problems specific to the prenatal context, including selection on pregnancy and effects of postnatal exposure. Future prenatal MR studies should report and attempt to falsify their assumptions, with particular attention to issues specific to prenatal MR. Further research is needed to evaluate the impacts of biases unique to prenatal MR in practice.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Metabolite levels within an individual vary over time. This within-individual variability, coupled with technical variability, reduces the power for epidemiologic studies to detect associations with disease. Here, the authors assess the variability of a large subset of metabolites and evaluate the implications for epidemiologic studies. METHODS: Using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) and gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC/MS) platforms, 385 metabolites were measured in 60 women at baseline and year-one of the Shanghai Physical Activity Study, and observed patterns were confirmed in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening study. RESULTS: Although the authors found high technical reliability (median intraclass correlation = 0.8), reliability over time within an individual was low. Taken together, variability in the assay and variability within the individual accounted for the majority of variability for 64{\%} of metabolites. Given this, a metabolite would need, on average, a relative risk of 3 (comparing upper and lower quartiles of "usual" levels) or 2 (comparing quartiles of observed levels) to be detected in 38{\%}, 74{\%}, and 97{\%} of studies including 500, 1,000, and 5,000 individuals. Age, gender, and fasting status factors, which are often of less interest in epidemiologic studies, were associated with 30{\%}, 67{\%}, and 34{\%} of metabolites, respectively, but the associations were weak and explained only a small proportion of the total metabolite variability. CONCLUSION: Metabolomics will require large, but feasible, sample sizes to detect the moderate effect sizes typical for epidemiologic studies. IMPACT: We offer guidelines for determining the sample sizes needed to conduct metabolomic studies in epidemiology.},

abstract = {Biological differences exist in the body composition of blacks and whites. We reviewed literature on the differences and similarities between the 2 races relative to fat-free body mass (water, mineral, and protein), fat patterning, and body dimensions and proportions. In general, blacks have a greater bone mineral density and body protein content than do whites, resulting in a greater fat-free body density. Additionally, there are racial differences in the distribution of subcutaneous fat and the length of the limbs relative to the trunk. The possibility that these differences are a result of ethnicity rather than of race is also examined. Because most equations that predict relative body fat were derived from predominantly white samples, biological variation between the races in these body-composition indexes has practical significance. Systematic error can result in the inaccurate estimation of the relative body fat of blacks, and therefore of definitions of obesity, if these inherent differences are ignored.},

All participants were free of clinical CVD at baseline with available BMI index and CVD outcomes data. Data were analyzed from October 2016 to July 2017.World Health Organization–standardized BMI categories.Total CVD and CVD subtype, including fatal and nonfatal coronary heart disease, stroke, congestive heart failure, and other CVD deaths. Heights and weights were measured directly by investigators in each study, and BMI was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared. We performed (1) modified Kaplan-Meier analysis to estimate lifetime risks, (2) adjusted competing Cox models to estimate joint cumulative risks for CVD or noncardiovascular death, and (3) the Irwin restricted mean to estimate years lived free of and with CVD.Of the 190 672 in-person examinations included in this study, the mean (SD) age was 46.0 (15.0) years for men and 58.7 (12.9) years for women, and 140 835 patients (73.9{\%}) were female. Compared with individuals with a normal BMI (defined as a BMI of 18.5 to 24.9), lifetime risks for incident CVD were higher in middle-aged adults in the overweight and obese groups. Compared with normal weight, among middle-aged men and women, competing hazard ratios for incident CVD were 1.21 (95{\%} CI, 1.14-1.28) and 1.32 (95{\%} CI, 1.24-1.40), respectively, for overweight (BMI, 25.0-29.9), 1.67 (95{\%} CI, 1.55-1.79) and 1.85 (95{\%} CI, 1.72-1.99) for obesity (BMI, 30.0-39.9), and 3.14 (95{\%} CI, 2.48-3.97) and 2.53 (95{\%} CI, 2.20-2.91) for morbid obesity (BMI, ≥40.0). Higher BMI had the strongest association with incident heart failure among CVD subtypes. Average years lived with CVD were longer for middle-aged adults in the overweight and obese groups compared with adults in the normal BMI group. Similar patterns were observed in younger and older adults.In this study, obesity was associated with shorter longevity and significantly increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality compared with normal BMI. Despite similar longevity compared with normal BMI, overweight was associated with significantly increased risk of developing CVD at an earlier age, resulting in a greater proportion of life lived with CVD morbidity.},

abstract = {Comprehensive characterization of human tissues promises novel insights into the biological architecture of human diseases and traits. We assessed metabonomic, transcriptomic, and genomic variation for a large population-based cohort from the capital region of Finland. Network analyses identified a set of highly correlated genes, the lipid-leukocyte (LL) module, as having a prominent role in over 80 serum metabolites (of 134 measures quantified), including lipoprotein subclasses, lipids, and amino acids. Concurrent association with immune response markers suggested the LL module as a possible link between inflammation, metabolism, and adiposity. Further, genomic variation was used to generate a directed network and infer LL module's largely reactive nature to metabolites. Finally, gene co-expression in circulating leukocytes was shown to be dependent on serum metabolite concentrations, providing evidence for the hypothesis that the coherence of molecular networks themselves is conditional on environmental factors. These findings show the importance and opportunity of systematic molecular investigation of human population samples. To facilitate and encourage this investigation, the metabonomic, transcriptomic, and genomic data used in this study have been made available as a resource for the research community. {\textcopyright} 2010 EMBO and Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.},

PREDICTORS: Waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), body mass index (BMI). OUTCOMES {\&} MEASUREMENTS: Incident CKD defined as serum creatinine level increase greater than 0.4 mg/dL with baseline creatinine level of 1.4 mg/dL or less in men and 1.2 mg/dL or less in women and final creatinine level greater than these levels, and, in separate analyses, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decrease of 15 mL/min/1.73 m(2) or greater with baseline eGFR of 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) or greater and final eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2). Multivariable logistic regression to determine the association between WHR, BMI, and outcomes. Cox models to evaluate a secondary composite outcome of all-cause mortality and incident CKD. RESULTS: Of 13,324 individuals, mean WHR was 0.96 in men and 0.89 in women and mean BMI was 27.2 kg/m(2) in both men and women. During 9.3 years, 300 patients (2.3{\%}) in creatinine-based models and 710 patients (5.5{\%}) in eGFR-based models developed CKD. In creatinine-based models, each SD increase in WHR was associated with increased risk of incident CKD (odds ratio, 1.22; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 1.05 to 1.43) and the composite outcome (hazard ratio, 1.12; 95{\%} CI, 1.06 to 1.18), whereas each SD increase in BMI was not associated with CKD (odds ratio, 1.05; 95{\%} CI, 0.93 to 1.20) and appeared protective for the composite outcome (hazard ratio, 0.94; 95{\%} CI, 0.90 to 0.99). Results of eGFR-based models were similar. LIMITATIONS: Single measures of creatinine, no albuminuria data. CONCLUSIONS: WHR, but not BMI, is associated with incident CKD and mortality. Assessment of CKD risk should use WHR rather than BMI as an anthropomorphic measure of obesity.},

abstract = {Mendelian randomization (MR) is a method for estimating the causal relationship between an exposure and an outcome using a genetic factor as an instrumental variable (IV) for the exposure. In the traditional MR setting, data on the IV, exposure, and outcome are available for all participants. However, obtaining complete exposure data may be difficult in some settings, due to high measurement costs or lack of appropriate biospecimens. We used simulated data sets to assess statistical power and bias for MR when exposure data are available for a subset (or an independent set) of participants. We show that obtaining exposure data for a subset of participants is a cost-efficient strategy, often having negligible effects on power in comparison with a traditional complete-data analysis. The size of the subset needed to achieve maximum power depends on IV strength, and maximum power is approximately equal to the power of traditional IV estimators. Weak IVs are shown to lead to bias towards the null when the subsample is small and towards the confounded association when the subset is relatively large. Various approaches for confidence interval calculation are considered. These results have important implications for reducing the costs and increasing the feasibility of MR studies.},

The authors present this discussion in the context of a Mendelian randomization analysis of the effect of body mass index (BMI; weight (kg)/height (m)2) on the risk of asthma at age 7 years (Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, 1991–1992). The authors show that the multiplicative structural mean model (MSMM) and the multiplicative generalized method of moments (MGMM) estimator produce identical estimates of the causal risk ratio. In the example, MSMM and MGMM estimates suggested an inverse relation between BMI and asthma but other IV estimates suggested a positive relation, although all estimates had wide confidence intervals. An interaction between the associations of BMI and fat mass and obesity-associated (FTO) genotype with asthma explained the different directions of the different estimates, and a simulation study supported the observation that MSMM/MGMM estimators are negatively correlated with the other estimators when such an interaction is present. The authors conclude that point estimates from various IV methods can differ in practical applications. Based on the theoretical properties of the estimators, structural mean models make weaker assumptions than other IV estimators and can therefore be expected to be consistent in a wider range of situations.},

In this study conducted in samples of 81 men and 70 women, data are presented on the anthropornetric correlates of abdominal visceral adipose tissue accumulation and related cardiovascular disease risk factors (trigiyceride and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, fasting and postglucose insulin and glucose levels). Results indicate that the waist circumference and the abdominal sagittal diameter are better correlates of abdominal visceral adipose tissue accumulation than the commonly used waist-to-hip ratio (WHR). In women, the waist circumference and the abdominal sagittal diameter also appeared more closely related to the metabolic variables than the WHR. When the samples were divided into quintiles of waist circumference, WHR or abdominal sagittal diameter, it was noted that increasing values of waist circumference and abdominal sagittal diameter were more consistently associated with increases in fasting and postglucose insulin levels than increasing values of WHR, especially in women. These findings suggest that the waist circumference or the abdominal sagittal diameter, rather than the WHR, should be used as indexes of abdominal visceral adipose tissue deposition and in the assessment of cardiovascular risk. It is suggested from these data that waist circumference values above approximately 100 cm, or abdominal sagittal diameter values {\textgreater}25 cm are most likely to be associated with potentially “atherogenic” metabolic disturbances.},

abstract = {Abstract Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are conducted with the promise to discover novel genetic variants associated with diverse traits. For most traits, associated markers individually explain just a modest fraction of the phenotypic variation, but their number can well be in the hundreds. We developed a maximum likelihood method that allows us to infer the distribution of associated variants even when many of them were missed by chance. Compared to previous approaches, the novelty of our method is that it (a) does not require having an independent (unbiased) estimate of the effect sizes; (b) makes use of the complete distribution of P-values while allowing for the false discovery rate; (c) takes into account allelic heterogeneity and the SNP pruning strategy. We applied our method to the latest GWAS meta-analysis results of the GIANT consortium. It revealed that while the explained variance of genome-wide (GW) significant SNPs is around 1{\%} for waist-hip ratio (WHR), the observed P-values provide evidence for the existence of variants explaining 10{\%} (CI=[8.5?11.5{\%}]) of the phenotypic variance in total. Similarly, the total explained variance likely to exist for height is estimated to be 29{\%} (CI=[28?30{\%}]), three times higher than what the observed GW significant SNPs give rise to. This methodology also enables us to predict the benefit of future GWA studies that aim to reveal more associated genetic markers via increased sample size. Genet.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Growing evidence suggests that abdominal obesity is a more important risk factor for the prognosis of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases than BMI. Somatic-affective symptoms of depression have also been linked to cardiovascular risk. The relationship between obesity and depression, however, has remained contradictory. Our aim was therefore to relate body mass index (BMI) and different measures for abdominal obesity (waist circumference, WC, waist-to-hip ratio, WHR, waist-to-height ratio, WHtR) to somatic vs. cognitive-affective symptoms of depression. METHODS: In a cross-sectional population based study, data on the first N = 5000 participants enrolled in the Gutenberg Health Study (GHS) are reported. To analyze the relationship between depression and obesity, we computed linear regression models with the anthropometric measure (BMI, WC, WHR, WHtR) as the dependent variable and life style factors, cardiovascular risk factors and psychotropic medications as potential confounders of obesity/depression. RESULTS: We found that only the somatic, but not the cognitive-affective symptoms of depression are consistently positively associated with anthropometric measures of obesity. CONCLUSIONS: We could demonstrate that the somatic-affective symptoms of depression rather than the cognitive-affective symptoms are strongly related to anthropometric measures.

abstract = {Consortium-based research is crucial for producing reliable high-quality findings  but existing tools for consortium studies have important drawbacks with respect to data protection, ease of deployment, and analytical rigor. To address these concerns, we developed COnsortium of METabolomics Studies (COMETS) Analytics to support and streamline consortium-based analyses of metabolomics and other omics data. The application requires no specialized expertise and can be run locally to guarantee data protection or through a web-based server for convenience and speed. Unlike other web-based tools, COMETS Analytics enables standardized models to be run across all cohorts, using an algorithmic, reproducible approach to diagnose, document, and fix model issues. This eliminates the time-consuming and potentially error-prone step of manually customizing models by cohort, helping to accelerate consortium-based projects and enhancing analytical reproducibility. We demonstrated that the application scales well by performing two data analyses in 45 cohort studies that together comprised measurements of 4,647 metabolites in up to 134,742 participants. COMETS Analytics performed well in this test, as judged by the minimal errors that analysts had in preparing data inputs and the successful execution of all models attempted. As metabolomics gathers momentum among biomedical and epidemiological researchers, COMETS Analytics may be a useful tool for facilitating large-scale consortium-based research.},

abstract = {Background Assessing the relationship between lung cancer and metabolic conditions is challenging because of the confounding effect of tobacco. Mendelian randomization (MR), or the use of genetic instrumental variables to assess causality, may help to identify the metabolic drivers of lung cancer. Methods and findings We identified genetic instruments for potential metabolic risk factors and evaluated these in relation to risk using 29,266 lung cancer cases (including 11,273 adenocarcinomas, 7,426 squamous cell and 2,664 small cell cases) and 56,450 controls. The MR risk analysis suggested a causal effect of body mass index (BMI) on lung cancer risk for two of the three major histological subtypes, with evidence of a risk increase for squamous cell carcinoma (odds ratio (OR) [95{\%} confidence interval (CI)] = 1.20 [1.01–1.43] and for small cell lung cancer (OR [95{\%}CI] = 1.52 [1.15–2.00]) for each standard deviation (SD) increase in BMI [4.6 kg/m2]), but not for adenocarcinoma (OR [95{\%}CI] = 0.93 [0.79–1.08]) (Pheterogeneity = 4.3x10-3). Additional analysis using a genetic instrument for BMI showed that each SD increase in BMI increased cigarette consumption by 1.27 cigarettes per day (P = 2.1x10-3), providing novel evidence that a genetic susceptibility to obesity influences smoking patterns. There was also evidence that low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was inversely associated with lung cancer overall risk (OR [95{\%}CI] = 0.90 [0.84–0.97] per SD of 38 mg/dl), while fasting insulin was positively associated (OR [95{\%}CI] = 1.63 [1.25–2.13] per SD of 44.4 pmol/l). Sensitivity analyses including a weighted-median approach and MR-Egger test did not detect other pleiotropic effects biasing the main results. Conclusions Our results are consistent with a causal role of fasting insulin and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in lung cancer etiology, as well as for BMI in squamous cell and small cell carcinoma. The latter relation may be mediated by a previously unrecognized effect of obesity on smoking behavior.},

abstract = {The best known genes of microbes, mice and men are those that specify enzymes. Wild type, mutant and heterozygote for variants of such genes differ in the catalytic activity at the step in the enzyme network specified by the gene in question. The effect on the respective phenotypes of such changes in catalytic activity, however, is not defined by the enzymes change as estimated by in vitro determination of the activities obtained from the extracts of the three groups. In vivo enzymes do not act in isolation, but are kinetically linked to other enzymes via their substrates and products. These interactions modify the effect of enzyme variation on the phenotype, depending on the nature and quantity of the other enzymes present. An output of such a system, say a flux, is therefore a systemic property, and its response to variation at one locus must be measured in the whole system. This response is best described by the sensitivity coefficient, Z, while is defined by the fractional change in flux over the fractional change in enzyme activity. (formula: see text). Its magnitude determines the extent to which a particular enzyme "controls" a particular flux or phenotype and, implicitly, determines the values that the three phenotypes will have. There are as many sensitivity coefficients for a given flux as there are enzymes in the system. It can be shown that the sum of all such coefficients equals unity. (formula: see text). Since n, the number of enzymes, is large, this summation property results in the individual coefficients being small. The effect of making a large change in enzyme activity therefore usually results in only a negligible change in flux. A reduction to 50{\%} activity in the heterozygote, a common feature for many mutants, is therefore not expected to be detectable in the phenotype. The mutant would therefore be described as "recessive". The widespread occurrence of recessive mutants is thus seen to be the inevitable consequence of the kinetic structure of enzyme networks. The ad hoc hypothesis of "modifiers" selected to maximize the fitness of the heterozygote, as proposed by Fisher, is therefore unnecessary. It is based on the false general expectation of an intermediate phenotype in the heterozygote. Wright's analysis, substantially sound in its approach, proposed selection of a "safety factor" in enzyme activity. The derivation of the summation property explains why such safety factors are automatically present in almost all enzymes without selection.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: Liver disease is traditionally categorized as alcoholic and non-alcoholic. We studied various risk factors predictive of advanced non-viral liver disease in general population and analyzed the interaction between these factors and alcohol consumption. METHODS: Persons without underlying liver disease who participated in the Health2000 or FINRISK studies 1992-2012 comprised a cohort of 41 260 individuals. Pattern of alcohol consumption and metabolic, lifestyle-related, and anthropometric parameters were analyzed with Cox regression analysis using severe liver disease hospitalization, cancer, or death as end-point. Viral liver diseases were excluded. RESULTS: A total of 355 liver events occurred during the mean 12.4-year follow-up (511 789 person-years). In the multivariate model, age (hazard ratio [HR] 1.03, P = 0.0083 for men; HR 1.04, P = 0.0198 for women), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) (HR 1.52, P = 0.0006 for men; HR 1.58, P = 0.0167 for women), patatin-like phospholipase-containing domain 3 mutations (HR 1.9, P = 0.024 for men; HR 2.7, P = 0.0109 for women), and weekly binge drinking (HR 2.4, P = 0.0024 for men; HR 7.4, P {\textless} 0.0001 for women) predicted development of severe liver disease. Among men, diabetes (HR 2.7, P = 0.0002), average alcohol consumption (HR for 10 g/day 1.1, P = 0.0022), non-married status (HR 1.9, P = 0.0397 for single; HR 2.4, P = 0.0002 for widowed/separated), and serum high-density lipoprotein (HR 2.2, P = 0.0022) and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HR 1.2, P = 0.0237) were additional risk factors. Alcohol intake increased the risk especially among persons with high WHR (P for interaction 0.009). CONCLUSIONS: Age, patatin-like phospholipase-containing domain 3 haplotype, and WHR increase the risk for development of severe liver disease. We found strong synergism between alcohol and central obesity. Binge drinking is an additional risk factor.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between migraine and body composition status as estimated based on body mass index and WHO physical status categories. METHODS: Systematic electronic database searches were conducted for relevant studies. Two independent reviewers performed data extraction and quality appraisal. Odds ratios (OR) and confidence intervals (CI) were pooled using a random effects model. Significant values, weighted effect sizes, and tests of homogeneity of variance were calculated. RESULTS: A total of 12 studies, encompassing data from 288,981 unique participants, were included. The age- and sex-adjusted pooled risk of migraine in those with obesity was increased by 27{\%} compared with those of normal weight (odds ratio [OR] 1.27; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI] 1.16-1.37, p {\textless} 0.001) and remained increased after multivariate adjustments. Although the age- and sex-adjusted pooled migraine risk was increased in overweight individuals (OR 1.08; 95{\%} CI 1.04, 1.12, p {\textless} 0.001), significance was lost after multivariate adjustments. The age- and sex-adjusted pooled risk of migraine in underweight individuals was marginally increased by 13{\%} compared with those of normal weight (OR 1.13; 95{\%} CI 1.02, 1.24, p {\textless} 0.001) and remained increased after multivariate adjustments. CONCLUSIONS: The current body of evidence shows that the risk of migraine is increased in obese and underweight individuals. Studies are needed to confirm whether interventions that modify obesity status decrease the risk of migraine.},

abstract = {The physiological functions of the uterine endometrium (uterine lining) are preparation for implantation, maintenance of pregnancy if implantation occurs, and menstruation in the absence of pregnancy. The endometrium thus plays a pivotal role in reproduction and continuation of our species. Menstruation is a steroid-regulated event, and there are alternatives for a progesterone-primed endometrium, i.e., pregnancy or menstruation. Progesterone withdrawal is the trigger for menstruation. The menstruating endometrium is a physiological example of an injured or ?wounded? surface that is required to rapidly repair each month. The physiological events of menstruation and endometrial repair provide an accessible in vivo human model of inflammation and tissue repair. Progress in our understanding of endometrial pathophysiology has been facilitated by modern cellular and molecular discovery tools, along with animal models of simulated menses. Abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB), including heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB), imposes a massive burden on society, affecting one in four women of reproductive age. Understanding structural and nonstructural causes underpinning AUB is essential to optimize and provide precision in patient management. This is facilitated by careful classification of causes of bleeding. We highlight the crucial need for understanding mechanisms underpinning menstruation and its aberrations. The endometrium is a prime target tissue for selective progesterone receptor modulators (SPRMs). This class of compounds has therapeutic potential for the clinical unmet need of HMB. SPRMs reduce menstrual bleeding by mechanisms still largely unknown. Human menstruation remains a taboo topic, and many questions concerning endometrial physiology that pertain to menstrual bleeding are yet to be answered.},

Using 2,571 genome-wide significant associations, we demonstrate that the genetic determinants of testosterone levels are substantially different between sexes and that genetically higher testosterone is harmful for metabolic diseases in women but beneficial in men. For example, a genetically determined 1 s.d. higher testosterone increases the risks of type 2 diabetes (odds ratio (OR) = 1.37 (95{\%} confidence interval (95{\%} CI): 1.22–1.53)) and polycystic ovary syndrome (OR = 1.51 (95{\%} CI: 1.33–1.72)) in women, but reduces type 2 diabetes risk in men (OR = 0.86 (95{\%} CI: 0.76–0.98)). We also show adverse effects of higher testosterone on breast and endometrial cancers in women and prostate cancer in men.

Both intelligence and education had beneficial total effects. Higher intelligence had positive direct effects on income and alcohol consumption, and negative direct effects on moderate and vigorous physical activity. Higher educational attainment had positive direct effects on income, alcohol consumption, and vigorous physical activity, and negative direct effects on smoking, BMI and sedentary behaviour.

Twelve loci reached genome-wide significance (P{\textless}5 × 10−8), of which eight were previously associated with increased overall adiposity (BMI, BF{\%}) and four (in or near COBLL1/GRB14, IGF2BP1, PLA2G6, CRTC1) were novel associations with BF{\%}. Seven loci showed a larger effect on BF{\%} than on BMI, suggestive of a primary association with adiposity, while five loci showed larger effects on BMI than on BF{\%}, suggesting association with both fat and lean mass.

abstract = {Studies have reported conflicting results on the association between body mass index (BMI) and prognosis of colorectal cancer. Therefore, we have conducted a meta-analysis of prospective studies, which examined the association of pre- and post-diagnostic BMI with colorectal cancer-specific mortality and all-cause mortality in patients with colorectal cancer. We searched Medline and EMBASE database published between 1970 and September 2014. A total of 508 articles were identified, of which 16 prospective cohort studies were included for the current meta-analysis. The analysis included 58,917 patients who were followed up over a period ranging from 4.9 to 20 years (median: 9.9 years). We found that being underweight before cancer diagnosis was associated with increased all-cause mortality (Relative risk [RR]: 1.63, 95{\%} CI: 1.18-2.23, p {\textless} 0.01) and being obese (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m(2)) before cancer diagnosis was associated with increased colorectal cancer-specific mortality (RR: 1.22, 95{\%} CI: 1.003-1.35, p {\textless} 0.01) and all-cause mortality (RR: 1.25, 95{\%} CI: 1.14-1.36, p {\textless} 0.01). On the other hand, being underweight (RR: 1.33, 95{\%} CI: 1.20-1.47, p {\textless} 0.01), obese (RR: 1.08, 95{\%} CI: 1.03-1.3, p {\textless} 0.01), and class II/III obese (BMI ≥ 35 kg/m(2); RR: 1.13, 95{\%} CI: 1.04-1.23, p {\textless} 0.01) after diagnosis were associated with significantly increased all-cause mortality. Being obese prior to diagnosis of colorectal cancer was associated with increased colorectal cancer-specific mortality and all-cause mortality, whereas being obese after diagnosis was associated with increased all-cause mortality. The associations with being underweight may reflect reverse causation. Maintaining a healthy body weight should be discussed with colorectal cancer survivors.},

In this review, we will discuss the mechanical effects of obesity on lung physiology and the function of adipose tissue as an endocrine organ producing systemic inflammation and effecting central respiratory control. Obesity plays a key role in the development of obstructive sleep apnea and obesity hypoventilation syndrome. Asthma is more common and often harder to treat in the obese population, and in this study, we review the effects of obesity on airway inflammation and respiratory mechanics. We also discuss the compounding effects of obesity on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and the paradoxical interaction of body mass index and COPD severity. Many practical challenges exist in caring for obese patients, and we highlight the complications faced by patients undergoing surgical procedures, especially given the increased use of bariatric surgery. Ultimately, a greater understanding of the effects of obesity on the respiratory disease and the provision of adequate health care resources is vital in order to care for this increasingly important patient population.},

abstract = {Obesity increases a number of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, but patients with many types of CVD may have a better prognosis if classified as overweight or obese, a phenomenon known as the “obesity paradox”. This paradoxical benefit of a medically unfavorable phenotype is particularly strong in the overweight and class I obesity, and less pronounced in the more severe or morbidly obese populations (class II–III and greater). Rather than an obesity paradox, it is possible that this phenomenon may represent a “lean paradox”, in which individuals classified as normal weight or underweight may have a poorer prognosis with respect to CVD, as a result of a progressive catabolic state and lean mass loss. Cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) is a fundamental part of this discussion. A greater CRF is associated with lower CVD risk, regardless of body mass index (BMI). Also, the assessment of body composition compartments (i.e., fat mass, fat-free mass, lean mass) and the presence of metabolic derangements may be better indicators of CVD risk than BMI alone. The focus of this review is to summarize the current evidence of the obesity paradox. Moreover, we discuss the utility and limitations of BMI for cardiometabolic risk stratification, in addition to concepts such as “metabolically healthy obesity” (MHO) and the “fat but fit” phenomenon, which describe patients who are diagnosed with obesity using BMI, but without major metabolic derangements and with greater CRF, respectively. Finally, we propose that obese patients presenting with an excess body fat, yet without metabolic abnormalities, should still be viewed as an “at risk” population, and as such should receive advice to change their lifestyle to improve their CRF and to prevent the development of impaired fasting glucose, diabetes mellitus and other CVD risk factors as a form of primary prevention.},

Data sources Medline, Embase, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and screening of citations and references. Eligibility criteria Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of observational studies that examined associations between SUA level and health outcomes, meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials that investigated health outcomes related to SUA lowering treatment, and Mendelian randomisation studies that explored the causal associations of SUA level with health outcomes. Results 57 articles reporting 15 systematic reviews and144 meta-analyses of observational studies (76 unique outcomes), 8 articles reporting 31 meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials (20 unique outcomes), and 36 articles reporting 107 Mendelian randomisation studies (56 unique outcomes) met the eligibility criteria. Across all three study types, 136 unique health outcomes were reported. 16 unique outcomes in meta-analyses of observational studies had P{\&}lt;10-6, 8 unique outcomes in meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials had P{\&}lt;0.001, and 4 unique outcomes in Mendelian randomisation studies had P{\&}lt;0.01. Large between study heterogeneity was common (80{\%} and 45{\%} in meta-analyses of observational studies and of randomised controlled trials, respectively). 42 (55{\%}) meta-analyses of observational studies and 7 (35{\%}) meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials showed evidence of small study effects or excess significance bias. No associations from meta-analyses of observational studies were classified as convincing; five associations were classified as highly suggestive (increased risk of heart failure, hypertension, impaired fasting glucose or diabetes, chronic kidney disease, coronary heart disease mortality with high SUA levels). Only one outcome from randomised controlled trials (decreased risk of nephrolithiasis recurrence with SUA lowering treatment) had P{\&}lt;0.001, a 95{\%} prediction interval excluding the null, and no large heterogeneity or bias. Only one outcome from Mendelian randomisation studies (increased risk of gout with high SUA levels) presented convincing evidence. Hypertension and chronic kidney disease showed concordant evidence in meta-analyses of observational studies, and in some (but not all) meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials with respective intermediate or surrogate outcomes, but they were not statistically significant in Mendelian randomisation studies. Conclusion Despite a few hundred systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and Mendelian randomisation studies exploring 136 unique health outcomes, convincing evidence of a clear role of SUA level only exists for gout and nephrolithiasis.},

It is usually diagnosed at advanced stages due to the limitations of current screening methods used in the clinic. There is an urgent need to develop new biomarkers and modalities to detect, diagnose, and monitor the disease. Metabonomics, an approach that involves the comprehensive profiling of the full complement of endogenous metabolites in a biological system, has demonstrated its great potential for use in the early diagnosis and personalized treatment of various cancers including CRC. By applying advanced analytical techniques and bioinformatics tools, the metabolome is mined for biomarkers that are associated with carcinogenesis and prognosis. This review provides an overview of the metabonomics workflow and studies, with a focus on recent advances and findings in biomarker discovery for the early diagnosis and prognosis of CRC.},

abstract = {The mechanisms that predispose to hypertension, coronary artery disease (CAD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) in individuals of normal weight are poorly understood. In contrast, in monogenic primary lipodystrophy – a reduction in subcutaneous adipose tissue – it is clear that it is adipose dysfunction that causes severe insulin resistance (IR), hypertension, coronary artery disease and type 2 diabetes. We aimed to test the hypothesis that common alleles associated with insulin resistance also influence the wider clinical and biochemical profile of monogenic insulin resistance. We selected 19 common genetic variants associated with fasting insulin based measures of insulin resistance. We used hierarchical clustering and results from genome wide association studies of 8 non-disease outcomes of monogenic insulin resistance, to group these variants. We analysed genetic risk scores against disease outcomes including 12,171 T2D cases, 40,365 CAD cases and 69,828 individuals with blood pressure measurements. Hierarchical clustering identified 11 variants associated with a metabolic profile consistent with a common, subtle, form of lipodystrophy. A genetic risk score consisting of these 11 IR risk alleles was associated with higher triglycerides ({\ss}=0.018; p=4x10-29), lower HDL cholesterol ({\ss}=-0.020; p=7x10-37), greater hepatic steatosis ({\ss}=0.021; p=3x10-4) higher alanine transaminase ({\ss}=0.002; p=3x10-5), lower SHBG ({\ss}=-0.010; p=9x10-13) and lower adiponectin ({\ss}=-0.015; p=2x10-26). The same risk alleles were associated with lower BMI (per-allele {\ss}=-0.008; p=7x10-8), and increased visceral-to-subcutaneous adipose tissue ratio ({\ss}=-0.015; p=6x10-7). Individuals carrying {\textgreater}= 17 fasting insulin raising alleles (5.5{\%} population) were slimmer (0.30 kgm-2) but at increased risk of T2D (odds ratio [OR] 1.46, per-allele p=5x10-13), CAD (OR 1.12, per-allele p=1x10-5), and increased blood pressure (systolic and diastolic blood pressure of 1.21 mmHg (per-allele p=2x10-5), and 0.67 mmHg (per-allele p=2x10-4), respectively, compared to individuals carrying {\textless}=9 risk alleles (5.5{\%} population).

abstract = {Background: Adiposity traits have been associated with risk of many cancers in observational studies, but whether these associations are causal is unclear. Mendelian randomization (MR) uses genetic predictors of risk factors as instrumental variables to eliminate reverse causation and reduce confounding bias. We performed MR analyses to assess the possible causal relationship of birthweight, childhood and adult body mass index (BMI), and waist-hip ratio (WHR) on the risks of breast, ovarian, prostate, colorectal and lung cancers. Methods: We tested the association between genetic risk scores and each trait using summary statistics from published genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and from 51 537 cancer cases and 61 600 controls in the Genetic Associations and Mechanisms in Oncology (GAME-ON) Consortium. Results: We found an inverse association between the genetic score for childhood BMI and risk of breast cancer [odds ratio (OR) = 0.71 per standard deviation (s.d.) increase in childhood BMI; 95{\%} confidence interval (CI): 0.60, 0.80; P  = 6.5 × 10 -5 ). We also found the genetic score for adult BMI to be inversely associated with breast cancer risk (OR = 0.66 per s.d. increase in BMI; 95{\%} CI: 0.57, 0.77; P  = 2.5 × 10 -7 ), and positively associated with ovarian cancer (OR = 1.35; 95{\%} CI: 1.05, 1.72; P  = 0.017), lung cancer (OR = 1.27; 95{\%} CI: 1.09, 1.49; P  = 2.9 × 10 -3 ) and colorectal cancer (OR = 1.39; 95{\%} CI: 1.06, 1.82, P  = 0.016). The inverse association between genetically predicted adult BMI and breast cancer risk remained even after adjusting for directional pleiotropy via MR-Egger regression. Conclusions: Findings from this study provide additional understandings of the complex relationship between adiposity and cancer risks. Our results for breast and lung cancer are particularly interesting, given previous reports of effect heterogeneity by menopausal status and smoking status. },

We conducted the present study to obtain an unbiased estimate of the prevalence of PCOS in unselected overweight and obese premenopausal women from Spain.All premenopausal women reporting to the Department of Endocrinology, Hospital Universitario Ram{\'{o}}n y Cajal, for dietary treatment of overweight or obesity from May 2002 to December 2005 were prospectively recruited. Women referred for any other reason were automatically excluded to avoid selection bias. Diagnosis of PCOS relied on the presence of clinical and/or biochemical hyperandrogenism, oligo-ovulation, and exclusion of secondary causes. Anthropometric measurements, hirsutism scores, and androgen, gonadotropin, metabolic, and lipid profiles were obtained.Of a total of 113 consecutive women recruited, 32 (28.3{\%}) were diagnosed as having PCOS (95{\%} confidence interval, 20.0{\%}-36.6{\%}). The prevalence of PCOS was not different when considering the degree of obesity. Another 3 women presented with hyperandrogenemia without oligo-ovulation, 2 had idiopathic hirsutism, 2 had chronic oligomenorrhea without clinical or biochemical hyperandrogenism, and 2 had oligomenorrhea with hyperprolactinemia, precluding the diagnosis of PCOS. The remaining 72 women (63.7{\%}) had no evidence of hyperandrogenism or reproductive abnormalities.Our results demonstrate a 28.3{\%} prevalence of PCOS in overweight and obese women from Spain, which is markedly increased compared with the 5.5{\%} prevalence of PCOS in lean women of our country. Therefore, PCOS must be routinely ruled out in overweight and obese premenopausal women seeking advice for weight loss.Arch Intern Med. 2006;166:2081-2086--{\textgreater}},

We conducted an umbrella review of systematic reviews and meta-analyses and a systematic review of Mendelian randomization (MR) studies. PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were systematically searched from inception up to March 2019. Meta-analyses of observational studies and MR studies examining associations between CRP and health outcomes were identified, excluding studies on the diagnostic value of CRP for infections. We found 113 meta-analytic comparisons of observational studies and 196 MR analyses, covering a wide range of outcomes. The overwhelming majority of the meta-analyses of observational studies reported a nominally statistically significant result (95/113, 84.1{\%}); however, the majority of the meta-analyses displayed substantial heterogeneity (47.8{\%}), small study effects (39.8{\%}) or excess significance (41.6{\%}). Only two outcomes, cardiovascular mortality and venous thromboembolism, showed convincing evidence of association with CRP levels. When examining the MR literature, we found MR studies for 53/113 outcomes examined in the observational study meta-analyses but substantial support for a causal association with CRP was not observed for any phenotype. Despite the striking amount of research on CRP, convincing evidence for associations and causal effects is remarkably limited.},

@article{Richardson2020,
abstract = {Author summary  Why was this study done?  There is uncertainty regarding which lipid or apolipoprotein trait is the predominant atherogenic agent involved in the aetiology of lipids and coronary heart disease (CHD). The elucidation of such is important because not only does it clarify the aetiological understanding of the pathogenesis of CHD, it also hones the focus on the lipid- or apolipoprotein-related trait that should be the focus when developing lipid-modifying interventions.    What did the researchers do and find?  We used data on up to 441,016 participants from the UK Biobank to conduct genome-wide association analyses to find genetic variants reliably associated with lipoprotein lipid and apolipoprotein concentrations: this led to the identification of multiple independent genetic variants, each associated very robustly (at P {\textless} 5 × 10−8) with LDL cholesterol (220 genetic variants), apolipoprotein B (255 genetic variants), triglycerides (440 genetic variants), HDL cholesterol (534 genetic variants), and apolipoprotein A–I (440 genetic variants). Hundreds of these variants identified were novel, to our knowledge. When we explored the potential causal role of these lipids and apolipoproteins in isolation using Mendelian randomisation, we found evidence compatible with LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and apolipoprotein B increasing the risk of CHD and HDL cholesterol and apolipoproteins A-I lowering CHD risk. When we examined these lipids and apolipoproteins together in multivariable Mendelian randomisation, we found that only apolipoprotein B retained a robust relationship with the risk of CHD—the effect estimates for all other entities were either substantially attenuated to the null or reversed in direction.    What do these findings mean?  The analytical approach in this study implemented through multivariable Mendelian randomisation simultaneously accounts for genetic associations with lipids and apolipoproteins and should therefore provide more reliable insights into what is the underlying driver of CHD. These findings support that, amongst the repertoire of lipoprotein lipids and apolipoproteins that we investigated, apolipoprotein B has a fundamental role in the aetiology of CHD.},

abstract = {Mendelian randomization (MR) is a widely-used method for causal inference using genetic data. Mendelian randomization studies of unrelated individuals may be susceptible to bias from family structure, for example, through dynastic effects which occur when parental genotypes directly affect offspring phenotypes. Here we describe methods for within-family Mendelian randomization and through simulations show that family-based methods can overcome bias due to dynastic effects. We illustrate these issues empirically using data from 61,008 siblings from the UK Biobank and Nord-Tr{\o}ndelag Health Study. Both within-family and population-based Mendelian randomization analyses reproduced established effects of lower BMI reducing risk of diabetes and high blood pressure. However, while MR estimates from population-based samples of unrelated individuals suggested that taller height and lower BMI increase educational attainment, these effects largely disappeared in within-family MR analyses. We found differences between population-based and within-family based estimates, indicating the importance of controlling for family effects and population structure in Mendelian randomization studies.},

abstract = {Background: Methods for the assessment of changes in dietary intake across the life course are underdeveloped. Methods: We demonstrate the use of linear-spline multilevel models to summarize energy-intake trajectories through childhood and adolescence and their application as exposures, outcomes, or mediators. The Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children assessed children's dietary intake several times between ages 3 and 13 years, using both food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) and 3-day food diaries. We estimated energy-intake trajectories for 12,032 children using linear-spline multilevel models. We then assessed the associations of these trajectories with maternal body mass index (BMI), and later offspring BMI, and also their role in mediating the relation between maternal and offspring BMIs. Results: Models estimated average and individual energy intake at 3 years, and linear changes in energy intake from age 3 to 7 years and from age 7 to 13 years. By including the exposure (in this example, maternal BMI) in the multilevel model, we were able to estimate the average energy-intake trajectories across levels of the exposure. When energy-intake trajectories are the exposure for a later outcome (in this case offspring BMI) or a mediator (between maternal and offspring BMI), results were similar, whether using a two-step process (exporting individual-level intercepts and slopes from multilevel models and using these in linear regression/path analysis), or a single-step process (multivariate multilevel models). Trajectories were similar when FFQs and food diaries were assessed either separately, or when combined into one model. Conclusions: Linear-spline multilevel models provide useful summaries of trajectories of dietary intake that can be used as an exposure, outcome, or mediator.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Metabolomics may unravel important biological pathways involved in the pathophysiology of childhood obesity. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to 1) identify metabolites that differ significantly between nonobese and obese Hispanic children; 2) collapse metabolites into principal components (PCs) associated with obesity and metabolic risk, specifically hyperinsulinemia, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperleptinemia, and hyperuricemia; and 3) identify metabolites associated with energy expenditure and fat oxidation. DESIGN: This trial was a cross-sectional observational study of metabolomics by using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analyses performed on fasting plasma samples from 353 nonobese and 450 obese Hispanic children. RESULTS: Branched-chained amino acids (BCAAs) (Leu, Ile, and Val) and their catabolites, propionylcarnitine and butyrylcarnitine, were significantly elevated in obese children. Strikingly lower lysolipids and dicarboxylated fatty acids were seen in obese children. Steroid derivatives were markedly higher in obese children as were markers of inflammation and oxidative stress. PC6 (BCAAs and aromatic AAs) and PC10 (asparagine, glycine, and serine) made the largest contributions to body mass index, and PC10 and PC12 (acylcarnitines) made the largest contributions to adiposity. Metabolic risk factors and total energy expenditure were associated with PC6, PC9 (AA and tricarboxylic acid cycle metabolites), and PC10. Fat oxidation was inversely related to PC8 (lysolipids) and positively related to PC16 (acylcarnitines). CONCLUSIONS: Global metabolomic profiling in nonobese and obese children replicates the increased BCAA and acylcarnitine catabolism and changes in nucleotides, lysolipids, and inflammation markers seen in obese adults; however, a strong signature of reduced fatty acid catabolism and increased steroid derivatives may be unique to obese children. Metabolic flexibility in fuel use observed in obese children may occur through the activation of alternative intermediary pathways. Insulin resistance, hyperleptinemia, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperuricemia, and oxidative stress and inflammation evident in obese children are associated with distinct metabolomic profiles.},

Participants attended 1 of 22 assessment centers across the United Kingdom between 2006 and 2010. The present study was conducted from May 1 to July 11, 2016.Prevalence of hypertension, coronary heart disease, and type 2 diabetes were determined at assessment, based on self-report. Blood pressure was measured clinically. Participants self-reported sociodemographic information pertaining to relevant confounders. A polygenic risk score comprising 93 single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with BMI from previous genome-wide association studies was constructed, and the genetic risk score was applied to derive causal estimates using a mendelian randomization approach.Of the 119 859 individuals included in the study, 56 816 (47.4{\%}) were men; mean (SD) age was 56.87 (7.93) years. Mendelian randomization analysis showed significant positive associations between genetically instrumented higher BMI and risk of hypertension (odds ratio [OR] per 1-SD higher BMI, 1.64; 95{\%} CI, 1.48-1.83; P = 1.1 × 10−19), coronary heart disease (OR, 1.35; 95{\%} CI, 1.09-1.69; P = .007) and type 2 diabetes (OR, 2.53; 95{\%} CI, 2.04-3.13; P = 1.5 × 10−17), as well as systolic blood pressure ($\beta$ = 1.65 mm Hg; 95{\%} CI, 0.78-2.52 mm Hg; P = 2.0 × 10−04) and diastolic blood pressure ($\beta$  = 1.37 mm Hg; 95{\%} CI, 0.88-1.85 mm Hg; P = 3.6 × 10−08). These associations were independent of age, sex, Townsend deprivation scores, alcohol intake, and smoking history.The results of this study add to the burgeoning evidence of an association between higher BMI and increased risk of cardiometabolic diseases. This finding has relevance for public health policies in many countries with increasing obesity levels.},

@article{Fabbrini2010,
abstract = {Obesity is associated with an increased risk of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Steatosis, the hallmark feature of NAFLD, occurs when the rate of hepatic fatty acid uptake from plasma and de novo fatty acid synthesis is greater than the rate of fatty acid oxidation and export (as triglyceride within very low-density lipoprotein). Therefore, an excessive amount of intrahepatic triglyceride (IHTG) represents an imbalance between complex interactions of metabolic events. The presence of steatosis is associated with a constellation of adverse alterations in glucose, fatty acid, and lipoprotein metabolism. It is likely that abnormalities in fatty acid metabolism, in conjunction with adipose tissue, hepatic, and systemic inflammation, are key factors involved in the development of insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and other cardiometabolic risk factors associated with NAFLD. However, it is not clear whether NAFLD causes metabolic dysfunction or whether metabolic dysfunction is responsible for IHTG accumulation, or possibly both. Understanding the precise factors involved in the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of NAFLD will provide important insights into the mechanisms responsible for the cardiometabolic complications of obesity.},

For decades, in a plethora of observational epidemiological studies, HDL-C has shown consistent inverse associations with cardiovascular disease. However, both Mendelian randomization analyses and randomized controlled trials have recently shed light on this area of particularly confounded findings. Multiple HDL-C raising clinical trials have either failed or demonstrated benefit unrelated to increases in circulating HDL-C, in accordance with genetic findings.1–4},

This is the first preliminary study analyzing placental metabolomics in normal weight (NW) and obese (OB) pregnancies. METHODS: Twenty NW (18.5 ≤ BMI{\textless} 25 kg/m(2)) and eighteen OB (BMI≥ 30 kg/m(2)) pregnancies were studied. Placental biopsies were collected at elective caesarean section. Metabolites extraction method was optimized for hydrophilic and lipophilic phases, then analyzed with GC-MS. Univariate and PLS-DA multivariate analysis were applied. RESULTS: Univariate analysis showed increased uracil levels while multivariate PLS-DA analysis revealed lower levels of LC-PUFA derivatives in the lipophilic phase and several metabolites with significantly different levels in the hydrophilic phase of OB vs NW. DISCUSSION: Placental metabolome analysis of obese pregnancies showed differences in metabolites involved in antioxidant defenses, nucleotide production, as well as lipid synthesis and energy production, supporting a shift towards higher placental metabolism. OB placentas also showed a specific fatty acids profile suggesting a disruption of LC-PUFA biomagnification. This study can lay the foundation to further metabolomic placental characterization in maternal obesity. Metabolic signatures in obese placentas may reflect changes occurring in the intrauterine metabolic environment, which may affect the development of adult diseases.},

Although published reports from population-based studies are beginning to emerge, the number to date remains relatively small. Yet, there is great potential for using metabolomics in population-based studies to evaluate the effects of nutritional, pharmaceutical, and environmental exposures (the "exposome"); conduct risk assessments; predict disease development; and diagnose diseases. Currently, the majority of the metabolomics studies in human populations are in nutrition or nutrition-related fields. This symposium provided a timely venue to highlight the current state-of-science on the use of metabolomics in population-based research.

abstract = {Adipose tissue expands to accommodate increased lipid through hypertrophy of existing adipocytes and by initiating differentiation of preadipocytes. The capacity of adipose tissue to expand is critical for accommodating changes in energy availability, but this capacity is not an unlimited process and likely varies between individuals. We suggest that it is not the absolute amount of adipose tissue but rather the capacity of adipose tissue to expand that affects metabolic homeostasis. Here we highlight examples of disease states and transgenic animal models with altered adipose tissue function that support this hypothesis and discuss possible mechanisms by which altered adipose tissue expandability impairs metabolic homeostasisClinical observations and experiments using genetically modified mouse models, some of which are discussed here, demonstrate that our understanding of how adipose tissue affects metabolic homeostasis is still developing. Although we know that obesity is a major health concern that predisposes individuals to many secondary conditions, including insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, we suggest that it is not the absolute amount of adipose tissue that determines the metabolic disruption, but rather limited expansion capacity of the adipose tissue (Figure 1). Identifying adipose tissue expandability as an important factor in preventing lipotox-icity and associated metabolic complications may introduce new therapeutic approaches that promote adipose tissue storage capacity. Although this is a counterintuitive suggestion for the treatment of obesity-related diabetes, this would expand the safe storage depot for lipid and prevent the accumulation of toxic lipid species in non-adipose tissues.},

OUTCOMES {\&} MEASUREMENTS: Incident CKD defined as serum creatinine level increase greater than 0.4 mg/dL with baseline creatinine level of 1.4 mg/dL or less in men and 1.2 mg/dL or less in women and final creatinine level greater than these levels, and, in separate analyses, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decrease of 15 mL/min/1.73 m(2) or greater with baseline eGFR of 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) or greater and final eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2). Multivariable logistic regression to determine the association between WHR, BMI, and outcomes. Cox models to evaluate a secondary composite outcome of all-cause mortality and incident CKD. RESULTS: Of 13,324 individuals, mean WHR was 0.96 in men and 0.89 in women and mean BMI was 27.2 kg/m(2) in both men and women. During 9.3 years, 300 patients (2.3{\%}) in creatinine-based models and 710 patients (5.5{\%}) in eGFR-based models developed CKD. In creatinine-based models, each SD increase in WHR was associated with increased risk of incident CKD (odds ratio, 1.22; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 1.05 to 1.43) and the composite outcome (hazard ratio, 1.12; 95{\%} CI, 1.06 to 1.18), whereas each SD increase in BMI was not associated with CKD (odds ratio, 1.05; 95{\%} CI, 0.93 to 1.20) and appeared protective for the composite outcome (hazard ratio, 0.94; 95{\%} CI, 0.90 to 0.99). Results of eGFR-based models were similar. LIMITATIONS: Single measures of creatinine, no albuminuria data. CONCLUSIONS: WHR, but not BMI, is associated with incident CKD and mortality. Assessment of CKD risk should use WHR rather than BMI as an anthropomorphic measure of obesity.},

abstract = {Abstract: Sustained hyperglycemia impairs insulin-stimulated glucose utilization and glycogen synthesis in human and rat skeletal muscles, a phenomenon referred to clinically as glucose toxicity. In rat extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle preparations preincubated for 2-4 h in a hyperglycemic medium (25 mM vs. 0 mM glucose), we have shown that the ability of insulin to stimulate glucose incorporation into glycogen is impaired. Interestingly, this was associated with a decreased activation of Akt/PKB, but not its upstream regulator, PI3-kinase. A similar pattern of signaling abnormalities has been observed in adipocytes, L6 muscle cells, C2C12 cells, and (as reported here) EDL incubated with C2-ceramide. On the other hand, no increase was observed in ceramide mass in EDL incubated with 25 mM glucose. Hyperglycemia-induced insulin resistance also has been described in adipocytes, where it has been linked to activation of novel and conventional protein kinase C isoforms that phosphorylate the insulin receptor and IRS. In addition, we have recently shown that hyperglycemia causes insulin resistance in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). Here, it was associated with an increased propensity to apoptosis and, as in muscle, with an impaired ability of insulin to activate Akt. Interestingly, these effects of hyperglycemia and an increase in diacylglycerol synthesis, which is also caused, were prevented by adding AICAR, an activator of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), to the incubation medium. These results suggest that hyperglycemia causes insulin resistance in cells other than those in classic insulin target tissues. Whether AMPK activation can reverse or prevent insulin resistance in all of these cells remains to be determined.},

abstract = {Mendelian randomization (MR) of lipid traits in CAD has provided evidence for causal associations of LDL-C and TGs in CAD, but many lipid trait genetic variants have pleiotropic effects on other cardiovascular risk factors that may bias MR associations. The goal of this study was to evaluate pleiotropic effects of lipid trait genetic variants and to account for these effects in MR of lipid traits in CAD. We performed multivariable MR using inverse variance-weighted and MR-Egger methods in large (n ≥ 300,000) GWAS datasets. We found that 30{\%} of lipid trait genetic variants have effects on metabolic syndrome traits, including BMI, T2D, and systolic blood pressure (SBP). Nonetheless, in multivariable MR analysis, LDL-C, HDL-C, TGs, BMI, T2D, and SBP are independently associated with CAD, and each of these associations is robust to adjustment for directional pleiotropy. MR at loci linked to direct effects on HDL-C and TGs suggests locus- and mechanism-specific causal effects of these factors on CAD.},

abstract = {Background Sex differences in cardiometabolic disease risk are commonly observed across the life course but are poorly understood and may be due to different cardiometabolic consequences of adiposity in females and males. We examined whether adiposity influences cardiometabolic trait levels differently in females and males at four different life stages.Methods Data were from two generations (offspring, Generation 1 [G1] and their parents, Generation 0 [G0]) of the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children birth cohort study. Body mass index (BMI) and total fat mass from dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry were measured at mean age 9y, 15y and 18y in G1. Waist circumference was measured at 9y and 15y in G1. Concentrations of 148 cardiometabolic traits quantified using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy were measured at 15y, 18y and 25y in G1. In G0, all three adiposity measures and the same 148 traits were available at 50y.Using linear regression models, sex-specific associations of adiposity measures at each time point (9y, 15y and 18y) with cardiometabolic traits 3 to 6 years later were examined in G1. In G0, sex-specific associations of adiposity measures and cardiometabolic traits were examined cross- sectionally at 50y.Results 3081 G1 and 4887 G0 participants contributed to analyses. BMI was more strongly associated with key atherogenic traits in males at younger ages (15y-25y) and associations were more similar between the sexes or stronger in females at 50y, particularly for apolipoprotein-B-containing lipoprotein particles and lipid concentrations. For example, a 1- SD (3.8 kg/m2) higher BMI at 18y was associated with 0.36 SD (95{\%} Confidence Interval (CI) = 0.20, 0.52) higher concentrations of extremely large very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles at 25y in males compared with 0.15 SD (95{\%} CI = 0.09, 0.21) in females. In contrast, at 50y, a 1-SD (4.8 kg/m2) higher BMI was associated with 0.33 SD (95{\%} CI = 0.25, 0.42) and 0.30 SD (95{\%} CI = 0.26, 0.33) higher concentrations of extremely large VLDL particles in males and females respectively. Sex-specific associations of DXA-measured fat mass and waist circumference were similar to findings for BMI in both generations and at all ages.Conclusion The results of this study suggest that the adverse cardiometabolic effects of adiposity are stronger and begin earlier in the life course among males compared with females until mid life, particularly for key atherogenic lipids. Adolescent and young adult males may therefore be high priority targets for obesity prevention efforts.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThe UK Medical Research Council (MRC) and Wellcome (Grant ref: 217065/Z/19/Z) and the University of Bristol provide core support for ALSPAC.

The association of metabolite profiles across multiple cardiometabolic traits may lend insights into the interaction of obesity and metabolic health. We sought to investigate metabolic signatures of obesity and related cardiometabolic traits in the community using broad-based metabolomic profiling. METHODS AND RESULTS: We evaluated the association of 217 assayed metabolites and cross-sectional as well as longitudinal changes in cardiometabolic traits among 2,383 Framingham Offspring cohort participants. Body mass index (BMI) was associated with 69 of 217 metabolites (P{\textless}0.00023 for all), including aromatic (tyrosine, phenylalanine) and branched chain amino acids (valine, isoleucine, leucine). Additional metabolic pathways associated with BMI included the citric acid cycle (isocitrate, alpha-ketoglutarate, aconitate), the tryptophan pathway (kynurenine, kynurenic acid), and the urea cycle. There was considerable overlap in metabolite profiles between BMI, abdominal adiposity, insulin resistance [IR] and dyslipidemia, modest overlap of metabolite profiles between BMI and hyperglycemia, and little overlap with fasting glucose or elevated blood pressure. Metabolite profiles were associated with longitudinal changes in fasting glucose, but the involved metabolites (ornithine, 5-HIAA, aminoadipic acid, isoleucine, cotinine) were distinct from those associated with baseline glucose or other traits. Obesity status appeared to "modify" the association of 9 metabolites with IR. For example, bile acid metabolites were strongly associated with IR among obese but not lean individuals, whereas isoleucine had a stronger association with IR in lean individuals. CONCLUSIONS: In this large-scale metabolite profiling study, body mass index was associated with a broad range of metabolic alterations. Metabolite profiling highlighted considerable overlap with abdominal adiposity, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia, but not with fasting glucose or blood pressure traits.},

Intuitively, one might expect disease-causing variants to cluster into key pathways that drive disease etiology. But for complex traits, association signals tend to be spread across most of the genome-including near many genes without an obvious connection to disease. We propose that gene regulatory networks are sufficiently interconnected such that all genes expressed in disease-relevant cells are liable to affect the functions of core disease-related genes and that most heritability can be explained by effects on genes outside core pathways. We refer to this hypothesis as an "omnigenic" model.},

However, obesity's influence on dementia remains poorly understood. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis. PUBMED search (1995-2007) resulted in 10 relevant prospective cohort studies of older adults (40-80 years at baseline) with end points being dementia and predictors including adiposity measures, such as body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC). There was a significant U-shaped association between BMI and dementia (P = 0.034), with dementia risk increased for obesity and underweight. Pooled odds ratios (OR) and 95{\%} confidence intervals (CI) for underweight, overweight and obesity compared with normal weight in relation to incident dementia were: 1.36 (1.07, 1.73), 0.88 (0.60, 1.27) and 1.42 (0.93, 2.18) respectively. Pooled ORs and 95{\%} CI for obesity and incident Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia were 1.80 (1.00, 3.29) vs. 1.73 (0.47, 6.31) and were stronger in studies with long follow-up ({\textgreater}10 years) and young baseline age ({\textless}60 years). Weight gain and high WC or skin-fold thickness increased risks of dementia in all included studies. The meta-analysis shows a moderate association between obesity and the risks for dementia and AD.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Body mass index (BMI)-for-age has been recommended as a screening test for excess adiposity in children and adolescents. OBJECTIVE: We quantified the performance of standard categories of BMI-for-age relative to the population prevalence of high adiposity in children and adolescents overall and by race-ethnic group in a nationally representative US population sample by using definitions of high adiposity that are consistent with expert committee recommendations. DESIGN: Percentage body fat in 8821 children and adolescents aged 8-19 y was measured by using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry in 1999-2004 as part of a health examination survey. RESULTS: With the use of several different cutoffs for percentage fat to define high adiposity, most children with high BMI-for-age ({\textgreater} or = 95th percentile of the growth charts) had high adiposity, and few children with normal BMI-for-age ({\textless}85th percentile) had high adiposity. The prevalence of high adiposity in intermediate BMI categories varied from 45{\%} to 15{\%} depending on the cutoff. The prevalence of a high BMI was significantly higher in non-Hispanic black girls than in non-Hispanic white girls, but the prevalence of high adiposity was not significantly different. CONCLUSIONS: Current BMI cutoffs can identify a high prevalence of high adiposity in children with high BMI-for-age and a low prevalence of high adiposity in children with normal BMI-for-age. By these adiposity measures, less than one-half of children with intermediate BMIs-for-age (85th to {\textless}95th percentile) have high adiposity. Differences in high BMI ranges between race-ethnic groups do not necessarily indicate differences in high adiposity.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE Type 2 diabetes develops for many years before diagnosis. We aimed to reveal early metabolic features characterizing liability to adult disease by examining genetic liability to adult type 2 diabetes in relation to metabolomic traits across early life.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Up to 4,761 offspring from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children were studied. Linear models were used to examine effects of a genetic risk score (162 variants) for adult type 2 diabetes on 229 metabolomic traits (lipoprotein subclass–specific cholesterol and triglycerides, amino acids, glycoprotein acetyls, and others) measured at age 8 years, 16 years, 18 years, and 25 years. Two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) was also conducted using genome-wide association study data on metabolomic traits in an independent sample of 24,925 adults.RESULTS At age 8 years, associations were most evident for type 2 diabetes liability (per SD higher) with lower lipids in HDL subtypes (e.g., −0.03 SD [95{\%} CI −0.06, −0.003] for total lipids in very large HDL). At 16 years, associations were stronger with preglycemic traits, including citrate and with glycoprotein acetyls (0.05 SD; 95{\%} CI 0.01, 0.08), and at 18 years, associations were stronger with branched-chain amino acids. At 25 years, associations had strengthened with VLDL lipids and remained consistent with previously altered traits, including HDL lipids. Two-sample MR estimates among adults indicated persistent patterns of effect of disease liability.CONCLUSIONS Our results support perturbed HDL lipid metabolism as one of the earliest features of type 2 diabetes liability, alongside higher branched-chain amino acid and inflammatory levels. Several features are apparent in childhood as early as age 8 years, decades before the clinical onset of disease.},

abstract = {There has been an alarming increase in the prevalence of obesity in people with type 1 diabetes in recent years. Although obesity has long been recognized as a major risk factor for the development of type 2 diabetes and a catalyst for complications, much less is known about the role of obesity in the initiation and pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes. Emerging evidence suggests that obesity contributes to insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and cardiometabolic complications in type 1 diabetes. Unique therapeutic strategies may be required to address these comorbidities within the context of intensive insulin therapy, which promotes weight gain. There is an urgent need for clinical guidelines for the prevention and management of obesity in type 1 diabetes. The development of these recommendations will require a transdisciplinary research strategy addressing metabolism, molecular mechanisms, lifestyle, neuropsychology, and novel therapeutics. In this review, the prevalence, clinical impact, energy balance physiology, and potential mechanisms of obesity in type 1 diabetes are described, with a special focus on the substantial gaps in knowledge in this field. Our goal is to provide a framework for the evidence base needed to develop type 1 diabetes–specific weight management recommendations that account for the competing outcomes of glycemic control and weight management.},

abstract = {Triangulation is the practice of obtaining more reliable answers to research questions through integrating results from several different approaches, where each approach has different key sources of potential bias that are unrelated to each other. With respect to causal questions in aetiological epidemiology, if the results of different approaches all point to the same conclusion, this strengthens confidence in the finding. This is particularly the case when the key sources of bias of some of the approaches would predict that findings would point in opposite directions if they were due to such biases. Where there are inconsistencies, understanding the key sources of bias of each approach can help to identify what further research is required to address the causal question. The aim of this paper is to illustrate how triangulation might be used to improve causal inference in aetiological epidemiology. We propose a minimum set of criteria for use in triangulation in aetiological epidemiology, summarize the key sources of bias of several approaches and describe how these might be integrated within a triangulation framework. We emphasize the importance of being explicit about the expected direction of bias within each approach, whenever this is possible, and seeking to identify approaches that would be expected to bias the true causal effect in different directions. We also note the importance, when comparing results, of taking account of differences in the duration and timing of exposures. We provide three examples to illustrate these points.},

abstract = {Metabolomics uses advanced analytical chemistry techniques to enable the high-throughput characterization of metabolites from cells, organs, tissues, or biofluids. The rapid growth in metabolomics is leading to a renewed interest in metabolism and the role that small molecule metabolites play in many biological processes. As a result, traditional views of metabolites as being simply the ?bricks and mortar? of cells or just the fuel for cellular energetics are being upended. Indeed, metabolites appear to have much more varied and far more important roles as signaling molecules, immune modulators, endogenous toxins, and environmental sensors. This review explores how metabolomics is yielding important new insights into a number of important biological and physiological processes. In particular, a major focus is on illustrating how metabolomics and discoveries made through metabolomics are improving our understanding of both normal physiology and the pathophysiology of many diseases. These discoveries are yielding new insights into how metabolites influence organ function, immune function, nutrient sensing, and gut physiology. Collectively, this work is leading to a much more unified and system-wide perspective of biology wherein metabolites, proteins, and genes are understood to interact synergistically to modify the actions and functions of organelles, organs, and organisms.},

abstract = {Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterized by the accumulation of excess liver triacylglycerol (TAG), inflammation, and liver damage. The goal of the present study was to directly quantify the biological sources of hepatic and plasma lipoprotein TAG in NAFLD. Patients (5 male and 4 female; 44 +/- 10 years of age) scheduled for a medically indicated liver biopsy were infused with and orally fed stable isotopes for 4 days to label and track serum nonesterified fatty acids (NEFAs), dietary fatty acids, and those derived from the de novo lipogenesis (DNL) pathway, present in liver tissue and lipoprotein TAG. Hepatic and lipoprotein TAG fatty acids were analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. NAFLD patients were obese, with fasting hypertriglyceridemia and hyperinsulinemia. Of the TAG accounted for in liver, 59.0{\%} +/- 9.9{\%} of TAG arose from NEFAs; 26.1{\%} +/- 6.7{\%}, from DNL; and 14.9{\%} +/- 7.0{\%}, from the diet. The pattern of labeling in VLDL was similar to that in liver, and throughout the 4 days of labeling, the liver demonstrated reciprocal use of adipose and dietary fatty acids. DNL was elevated in the fasting state and demonstrated no diurnal variation. These quantitative metabolic data document that both elevated peripheral fatty acids and DNL contribute to the accumulation of hepatic and lipoprotein fat in NAFLD.},

abstract = {Mendelian randomization (MR) provides us the opportunity to investigate the causal paths of metabolites in type 2 diabetes and glucose homeostasis. We developed and tested an MR approach based on genetic risk scoring for plasma metabolite levels, utilizing a pathway-based sensitivity analysis to control for nonspecific effects. We focused on 124 circulating metabolites that correlate with fasting glucose in the Erasmus Rucphen Family (ERF) study (n = 2,564) and tested the possible causal effect of each metabolite with glucose and type 2 diabetes and vice versa. We detected 14 paths with potential causal effects by MR, following pathway-based sensitivity analysis. Our results suggest that elevated plasma triglycerides might be partially responsible for increased glucose levels and type 2 diabetes risk, which is consistent with previous reports. Additionally, elevated HDL components, i.e., small HDL triglycerides, might have a causal role of elevating glucose levels. In contrast, large (L) and extra large (XL) HDL lipid components, i.e., XL-HDL cholesterol, XL-HDL–free cholesterol, XL-HDL phospholipids, L-HDL cholesterol, and L-HDL–free cholesterol, as well as HDL cholesterol seem to be protective against increasing fasting glucose but not against type 2 diabetes. Finally, we demonstrate that genetic predisposition to type 2 diabetes associates with increased levels of alanine and decreased levels of phosphatidylcholine alkyl-acyl C42:5 and phosphatidylcholine alkyl-acyl C44:4. Our MR results provide novel insight into promising causal paths to and from glucose and type 2 diabetes and underline the value of additional information from high-resolution metabolomics over classic biochemistry.},

The mechanisms that uncouple adiposity from its cardiometabolic complications are not fully understood. Here, we identify 62 loci of which the same allele is significantly associated with both higher adiposity and lower cardiometabolic risk. Functional analyses show that the 62 loci are enriched for genes expressed in adipose tissue, and for regulatory variants that influence nearby genes that affect adipocyte differentiation. Genes prioritized in each locus support a key role of fat distribution (FAM13A, IRS1 and PPARG) and adipocyte function (ALDH2, CCDC92, DNAH10, ESR1, FAM13A, MTOR, PIK3R1 and VEGFB). Several additional mechanisms are involved as well, such as insulin–glucose signalling (ADCY5, ARAP1, CREBBP, FAM13A, MTOR, PEPD, RAC1 and SH2B3), energy expenditure and fatty acid oxidation (IGF2BP2), browning of white adipose tissue (CSK, VEGFA, VEGFB and SLC22A3) and inflammation (SH2B3, DAGLB and ADCY9). Some of these genes may represent therapeutic targets to reduce cardiometabolic risk linked to excess adiposity.},

abstract = {Mendelian randomization (MR) studies typically assess the pathogenic relevance of environmental exposures or disease biomarkers, using genetic variants that instrument these exposures. The approach is gaining popularity-our systematic review reveals a greater than 10-fold increase in MR studies published between 2004 and 2015. When the MR paradigm was first proposed, few biomarker- or exposure-related genetic variants were known, most having been identified by candidate gene studies. However, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are now providing a rich source of potential instruments for MR analysis. Many early reviews covering the concept, applications and analytical aspects of the MR technique preceded the surge in GWAS, and thus the question of how best to select instruments for MR studies from the now extensive pool of available variants has received insufficient attention. Here we focus on the most common category of MR studies-those concerning disease biomarkers. We consider how the selection of instruments for MR analysis from GWAS requires consideration of: the assumptions underlying the MR approach; the biology of the biomarker; the genome-wide distribution, frequency and effect size of biomarker-associated variants (the genetic architecture); and the specificity of the genetic associations. Based on this, we develop guidance that may help investigators to plan and readers interpret MR studies.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Associations of C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration with risk of major diseases can best be assessed by long-term prospective follow-up of large numbers of people. We assessed the associations of CRP concentration with risk of vascular and non-vascular outcomes under different circumstances. METHODS: We meta-analysed individual records of 160 309 people without a history of vascular disease (ie, 1.31 million person-years at risk, 27 769 fatal or non-fatal disease outcomes) from 54 long-term prospective studies. Within-study regression analyses were adjusted for within-person variation in risk factor levels. RESULTS: Log(e) CRP concentration was linearly associated with several conventional risk factors and inflammatory markers, and nearly log-linearly with the risk of ischaemic vascular disease and non-vascular mortality. Risk ratios (RRs) for coronary heart disease per 1-SD higher log(e) CRP concentration (three-fold higher) were 1.63 (95{\%} CI 1.51-1.76) when initially adjusted for age and sex only, and 1.37 (1.27-1.48) when adjusted further for conventional risk factors; 1.44 (1.32-1.57) and 1.27 (1.15-1.40) for ischaemic stroke; 1.71 (1.53-1.91) and 1.55 (1.37-1.76) for vascular mortality; and 1.55 (1.41-1.69) and 1.54 (1.40-1.68) for non-vascular mortality. RRs were largely unchanged after exclusion of smokers or initial follow-up. After further adjustment for fibrinogen, the corresponding RRs were 1.23 (1.07-1.42) for coronary heart disease; 1.32 (1.18-1.49) for ischaemic stroke; 1.34 (1.18-1.52) for vascular mortality; and 1.34 (1.20-1.50) for non-vascular mortality. INTERPRETATION: CRP concentration has continuous associations with the risk of coronary heart disease, ischaemic stroke, vascular mortality, and death from several cancers and lung disease that are each of broadly similar size. The relevance of CRP to such a range of disorders is unclear. Associations with ischaemic vascular disease depend considerably on conventional risk factors and other markers of inflammation.

abstract = {Several recent papers have reported strong signals of selection on European polygenic height scores. These analyses used height effect estimates from the GIANT consortium and replication studies. Here, we describe a new analysis based on the the UK Biobank (UKB), a large, independent dataset. We find that the signals of selection using UKB effect estimates are strongly attenuated or absent. We also provide evidence that previous analyses were confounded by population stratification. Therefore, the conclusion of strong polygenic adaptation now lacks support. Moreover, these discrepancies highlight (1) that methods for correcting for population stratification in GWAS may not always be sufficient for polygenic trait analyses, and (2) that claims of differences in polygenic scores between populations should be treated with caution until these issues are better understood.

abstract = {The genetic architecture of common diseases is central to the scientific and clinical goals of human genetics because it directly impacts biology, disease screening, diagnosis, prognosis and treatment.Genetic architecture is currently assessed by exploiting the differences in types of genetic variants ascertained through genome-wide association studies, whole-exome sequencing studies and whole-genome sequencing studies. Each of these has its own merits and disadvantages, but all are subject to the limitations of sample size. Gene mapping studies should thus be tailored to the unique contributions of each of these technologies.To date, the observed genetic architecture of highly heritable diseases and traits differs markedly and cannot be reliably predicted. Where large sample sizes are available, differences in detectable architecture still exist.The concept of variance explained is not always relevant to individual-level risk prediction or drug development, whereas the genetic architecture of a given trait or disease can be more pertinent.Genetic architecture is variable in time and place and can be theoretically influenced by phenotypic measurement, selection and decanalization.Interactions between genetic determinants of a trait or environmental influences contribute to genetic architecture. To date, few such interactions have been identified for most common diseases and traits, but this will likely change with increasing sample sizes.},

We performed large scale meta-analyses and replications in up to 52,895 individuals for BMI and up to 23,095 individuals for WHRadjBMI from the African Ancestry Anthropometry Genetics Consortium (AAAGC) using 1000 Genomes phase 1 imputed GWAS to improve coverage of both common and low frequency variants in the low linkage disequilibrium African ancestry genomes.

An additional novel locus (SPRYD7/DLEU2) was identified for WHRadjBMI when combined with European GWAS.

The lead variants in 13 of these loci had a high probability of being causal. As compared to our previous HapMap imputed GWAS for BMI and WHRadjBMI including up to 71,412 and 27,350 African ancestry individuals, respectively, our results suggest that 1000 Genomes imputation showed modest improvement in identifying GWAS loci including low frequency variants.

To better understand these relationships, we examined cross-sectional associations between bone turnover markers (BTMs) and metabolic traits in a population with high bone mass (HBM, BMD Z-score ≥+3.2). Design ?-C-terminal telopeptide of type-I collagen (?-CTX), procollagen type-1 amino-terminal propeptide (P1NP) and osteocalcin were assessed by electrochemiluminescence immunoassays. Metabolic traits, including lipids and glycolysis-related metabolites, were measured using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Associations of BTMs with metabolic traits were assessed using generalized estimating equation linear regression, accounting for within-family correlation, adjusting for potential confounders (age, sex, height, weight, menopause, bisphosphonate and oral glucocorticoid use). Results A total of 198 adults with HBM had complete data, mean [SD] age 61.6 [13.7] years; 77{\%} were female. Of 23 summary metabolic traits, citrate was positively related to all BTMs: adjusted ??-CTX = 0.050 (95{\%} CI 0.024, 0.076), P = 1.71 ? 10?4, ?osteocalcin = 6.54 ? 10?4 (1.87 ? 10?4, 0.001), P = .006 and ?P1NP = 2.40 ? 10?4 (6.49 ? 10?5, 4.14 ? 10?4), P = .007 (? = increase in citrate (mmol/L) per 1 µg/L BTM increase). Inverse relationships of ?-CTX (? = ?0.276 [?0.434, ?0.118], P = 6.03 ? 10?4) and osteocalcin (?0.004 [?0.007, ?0.001], P = .020) with triglycerides were also identified. We explored the generalizability of these associations in 3664 perimenopausal women (age 47.9 [4.4] years) from a UK family cohort. We confirmed a positive, albeit lower magnitude, association between ?-CTX and citrate (adjusted ?women = 0.020 [0.013, 0.026], P = 1.95 ? 10?9) and an inverse association of similar magnitude between ?-CTX and triglycerides (? = ?0.354 [?0.471, ?0.237], P = 3.03 ? 10?9). Conclusions Bone resorption is positively related to circulating citrate and inversely related to triglycerides. Further studies are justified to determine whether plasma citrate or triglyceride concentrations are altered by factors known to modulate bone resorption, such as bisphosphonates.},

We examined the effect of lifetime body mass index (BMI) on adult carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) and various atherosclerotic risk factors by using both Mendelian randomization and conventional analyses.A total of 2230 individuals (1218 women), aged 3–18 at study induction, took part in clinical examinations in 1980, 1983, 1986, and, most recently, 2001 when they were aged 24–39. In these analyses we utilized the known relation between FTO polymorphism rs9939609 and BMI. The dose–response association between the number of A alleles in FTO and higher mean BMI from childhood to adulthood was confirmed, but no associations with potential confounding factors were observed. In standard regression models, lifetime BMI was associated with adult CIMT, lifetime systolic blood pressure, adult fasting glucose, and adult HOMA-index. When variation in FTO was used as an instrument for unconfounded BMI levels, similar or larger effects of lifetime BMI on all these phenotypes were found, although with wider confidence intervals.Mutually supportive results from Mendelian randomization and standard regression models strengthen the evidence of the effect of lifetime BMI on atherosclerosis risk in young adults.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Circulating C-reactive protein (CRP) is associated with the metabolic syndrome and might be causally linked to it. Our aim was to generate estimates of the association between plasma CRP and metabolic syndrome phenotypes that were free from confounding and reverse causation, to assess the causal role of this protein. METHODS: We examined associations between serum CRP concentration and metabolic syndrome phenotypes in the British Women's Heart and Health Study. We then compared these estimates with those derived from a mendelian randomised framework with common CRP gene haplotypes to generate unconfounded and unbiased estimates of any causal associations. FINDINGS: In a sample of British women, body-mass index (BMI), systolic blood pressure, waist-to-hip ratio, serum concentrations of HDL cholesterol and triglycerides, and insulin resistance were all associated with plasma CRP concentration. CRP haplotypes were associated with plasma CRP concentration (p{\textless}0.0001). With instrumental variable analyses, there was no association between plasma CRP concentration and any of the metabolic syndrome phenotypes analysed. There was strong evidence that linear regression and mendelian randomisation based estimation gave conflicting results for the CRP-BMI association (p=0.0002), and some evidence of conflicting results for the association of CRP with the score for insulin resistance (p=0.0139), triglycerides (p=0.0313), and HDL cholesterol (p=0.0688). INTERPRETATION: Disparity between estimates of the association between plasma CRP and phenotypes comprising the metabolic syndrome derived from conventional analyses and those from a mendelian randomisation approach suggests that there is no causal association between CRP and the metabolic syndrome phenotypes.},

abstract = {Author summary Understanding the causal relationships between pairs of traits is crucial for unravelling the causes of disease. To this end, results from genome-wide association studies are valuable because if a trait is known to be influenced by a genetic variant then this knowledge can be used to test the trait's causal influences on other traits and diseases. Here we discuss scenarios where the nature of the genetic association with the causal trait can lead existing causal inference methods to give the wrong direction of causality. We introduce a new method that can be applied to summary level data and is potentially less susceptible to problems such as measurement error, and apply it to evaluate the causal relationships between DNA methylation levels and gene expression. While our results show that DNA methylation is more likely to be the causal factor, we point out that is it crucial to acknowledge that systematic differences in measurement error between the platforms could influence such conclusions.},

abstract = {Understanding how metabolites are longitudinally influenced by age and sex could facilitate the identification of metabolomic profiles and trajectories that indicate disease risk. We investigated the metabolomics of age and sex using longitudinal plasma samples from the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention (WRAP), a cohort of participants who were dementia free at enrollment. Metabolomic profiles were quantified for 2,344 fasting plasma samples among 1,212 participants, each with up to three study visits. Of 1,097 metabolites tested, 623 (56.8{\%}) were associated with age and 695 (63.4{\%}) with sex after correcting for multiple testing. Approximately twice as many metabolites were associated with age in stratified analyses of women versus men, and 68 metabolite trajectories significantly differed by sex, most notably including sphingolipids, which tended to increase in women and decrease in men with age. Using genome-wide genotyping, we also report the heritabilities of metabolites investigated, which ranged dramatically (0.2-99.2{\%}); however, the median heritability of 36.2{\%} suggests that many metabolites are highly influenced by a complex combination of genomic and environmental influences. These findings offer a more profound description of the aging process and may inform many new hypotheses regarding the role metabolites play in healthy and accelerated aging.},

@article{Romero-Corral2008,
abstract = {Background: Body mass index (BMI) is the most widely used measure to diagnose obesity. However, the accuracy of BMI in detecting excess body adiposity in the adult general population is largely unknown. Methods: A cross-sectional design of 13 601 subjects (age 20-79.9 years; 49{\%} men) from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Bioelectrical impedance analysis was used to estimate body fat percent (BF{\%}). We assessed the diagnostic performance of BMI using the World Health Organization reference standard for obesity of BF{\%}{\textgreater}25{\%} in men and {\textgreater}35{\%} in women. We tested the correlation between BMI and both BF{\%} and lean mass by sex and age groups adjusted for race. Results: BMI-defined obesity (≥30 kg m -2 ) was present in 19.1{\%} of men and 24.7{\%} of women, while BF{\%}-defined obesity was present in 43.9{\%} of men and 52.3{\%} of women. A BMI≥30 had a high specificity (men=95{\%}, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI), 94-96 and women=99{\%}, 95{\%} CI, 98-100), but a poor sensitivity (men=36{\%}, 95{\%} CI, 35-37 and women=49{\%}, 95{\%} CI, 48-50) to detect BF{\%}-defined obesity. The diagnostic performance of BMI diminished as age increased. In men, BMI had a better correlation with lean mass than with BF{\%}, while in women BMI correlated better with BF{\%} than with lean mass. However, in the intermediate range of BMI (25-29.9 kg m -2 ), BMI failed to discriminate between BF{\%} and lean mass in both sexes. Conclusions: The accuracy of BMI in diagnosing obesity is limited, particularly for individuals in the intermediate BMI ranges, in men and in the elderly. A BMI cutoff of≥30 kg m -2 has good specificity but misses more than half of people with excess fat. These results may help to explain the unexpected better survival in overweight/mild obese patients. {\textcopyright} 2008 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Body mass index (BMI) is criticized for not distinguishing fat from lean mass and ignoring fat distribution, leaving its ability to detect health effects unclear. OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to compare BMI with total and regional fat indexes from dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry in their associations with cardiometabolic traits. Duration of exposure to and change in each index across adolescence were examined in relation to detailed traits in young adulthood. METHODS BMI was examined alongside total, trunk, arm, and leg fat indexes (each in kilograms per square meter) from dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry at ages 10 and 18 years in relation to 230 traits from targeted metabolomics at age 18 years in 2,840 offspring from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. RESULTS Higher total fat mass index and BMI at age 10 years were similarly associated with cardiometabolic traits at age 18 years, including higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure, higher very low-density lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, higher triglycerides, and higher insulin and glycoprotein acetyls. Associations were stronger for both indexes measured at age 18 years and for gains in each index from age 10 to 18 years (e.g., 0.45 SDs [95{\%} confidence interval: 0.38 to 0.53] in glycoprotein acetyls per SD unit gain in fat mass index vs. 0.38 SDs [95{\%} confidence interval: 0.27 to 0.48] per SD unit gain in BMI). Associations resembled those for trunk fat index. Higher lean mass index was weakly associated with traits and was not protective against higher fat mass index. CONCLUSIONS The results of this study support abdominal fatness as a primary driver of cardiometabolic dysfunction and BMI as a useful tool for detecting its effects.},

However, observational data are prone to confounding and reverse causation. In Mendelian randomization, genetic variants are used as unconfounded markers of exposures to examine causal effects. We examined the causal effect of BMI on asthma, hay fever, allergic sensitization, serum total immunoglobulin E (IgE), forced expiratory volume in one-second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC). Methods We included 490 497 participants in the observational and 162 124 participants in the genetic analyses. A genetic risk score (GRS) was created using 26 BMI-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Results were pooled in meta-analyses and expressed as odds ratios (ORs) or ?-estimates with 95{\%} confidence interval (CI). Results The GRS was significantly associated with asthma (OR=1.009; 95{\%} CI: 1.004, 1.013), but not with hay fever (OR= 0.998; 95{\%} CI: 0.994, 1.002) or allergic sensitization (OR=0.999; 95{\%} CI: 0.986, 1.012) per BMI-increasing allele. The GRS was significantly associated with decrease in FEV1: ?=?0.0012 (95{\%} CI: ?0.0019, ?0.0006) and FVC: ?=?0.0022 (95{\%} CI: ?0.0031, ?0.0014) per BMI-increasing allele. Effect sizes estimated by instrumental variable analyses were OR=1.07 (95{\%} CI: 1.03, 1.10) for asthma, a 9 ml decrease in FEV1 (95{\%} CI: 2.0-15 mL decrease) and a 16 ml decrease in FVC (95{\%} CI: 7.0-24 mL decrease) per 1 kg/m2 higher BMI. Conclusions The results support the conclusion that increasing BMI is causally related to higher prevalence of asthma and decreased lung function, but not with hay fever or biomarkers of allergy.},

abstract = {Summary Background Obesity is increasing in prevalence and placing an ever-greater burden on individuals and healthcare resources alike. Obesity management is complex and, for many, elusive. Aims and methods This paper reviews the major factors that influence psychological well-being in individuals with obesity and describes the means by which their impact on distress and other aspects of quality of life (QoL) can be quantified. The goal is to enable healthcare providers to set reasonable, achievable, maintainable weight loss targets that will improve the psychological well-being and QoL of individuals living with obesity. PubMed and Web of Science searches were conducted to identify literature that addresses the key question: How can distress over obesity be measured and taken into account when tailoring weight loss interventions for a particular patient? Discussion and conclusions ?Distress over obesity? is a key parameter that illustrates the psychological consequences of excess weight. Healthcare providers can draw on a range of obesity-specific and non-specific assessment tools to quantify distress as well as the other contributions of obesity to QoL and mental/emotional health. When physicians consider the psychological/QoL aspects of obesity and how these change with successful weight loss, it becomes possible to set achievable, realistic weight loss goals and develop a manageable plan to achieve them. Any future developments that make it easier to achieve these goals should be made widely available to all patients in need, in order to help them turn a vicious cycle of failure into a virtuous cycle of success.},

Between 1986 and 1992, the authors studied a total of 202 black and 504 white men and women who resided in or near New York City, were ages 20–94 years, and had BMIs of 18–35 kg/m2. Total body fat, expressed as a percentage of body weight (BF{\%}), was assessed using a four-compartment body composition model that does not rely on assumptions known to be age, sex, or ethnicity dependent. Statistically significant age dependencies were observed in the BF{\%}-BMI relations in all four sex and ethnic groups (p values {\textless} 0.05–0.001) with older persons showing a higher BF{\%} compared with younger persons with comparable BMIs. Statistically significant sex effects were also observed in BF{\%}-BMI relations within each ethnic group (p values {\textless} 0.001) after controlling first for age. For an equivalent BMI, women have significantly greater amounts of total body fat than do men throughout the entire adult life span. Ethnicity did not significantly influence the BF{\%}-BMI relation after controlling first for age and sex even though both black women and men had longer appendicular bone lengths relative to stature (p values {\textless} 0.001 and 0.02, respectively) compared with white women and men. Body mass index alone accounted for 25{\%} of between individual differences in body fat percentage for the 706 total subjects; adding age and sex as independent variables to the regression model increased the variance (r2) to 67{\%}. These results suggest that BMI is age and sex dependent when used as an indicator of body fatness, but that it is ethnicity independent in black and white adults.},

abstract = {Obesity is a disorder characterized by a disproportionate increase in body weight in relation to height, mainly due to the accumulation of fat, and is considered a pandemic of the present century by many international health institutions. It is associated with several non-communicable chronic diseases, namely, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), cardiovascular diseases (CVD), and cancer. Metabolomics is a useful tool to evaluate changes in metabolites due to being overweight and obesity at the body fluid and cellular levels and to ascertain metabolic changes in metabolically unhealthy overweight and obese individuals (MUHO) compared to metabolically healthy individuals (MHO).},

abstract = {Studies have identified that several amino acids, in particular, branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), have increased significantly in obese individuals when compared to lean individuals. Additionally, these metabolites were strongly associated with future diabetes, which rendered them prognostic markers suitable for obese populations. Here we report a metabonomic study that reveals new findings on the role of these amino acid markers, particularly BCAAs, in a Chinese cohort including 106 healthy obese and 105 healthy lean participants. We found that the BCAAs were correlated with insulin resistance and differentially expressed in obese men, but not in obese women. The results were verified with two independent groups of participants (Chinese, n = 105 and American, n = 72) and demonstrate that the serum metabolite profiles of the obese population are gender-dependent. The study supports the previous findings of a panel of several key metabolites as prognostic markers of the obese population and highlights the need to take into account gender differences when using these markers for risk assessment.},

Comprehensive molecular profiling of circulating metabolites captures highly heritable traits, which can help to uncover metabolic pathophysiology underlying established disease variants. We conduct an extended genome-wide association study of genetic influences on 123 circulating metabolic traits quantified by nuclear magnetic resonance metabolomics from up to 24,925 individuals and identify eight novel loci for amino acids, pyruvate and fatty acids. The LPA locus link with cardiovascular risk exemplifies how detailed metabolic profiling may inform underlying aetiology via extensive associations with very-low-density lipoprotein and triglyceride metabolism. Genetic fine mapping and Mendelian randomization uncover wide-spread causal effects of lipoprotein(a) on overall lipoprotein metabolism and we assess potential pleiotropic consequences of genetically elevated lipoprotein(a) on diverse morbidities via electronic health-care records. Our findings strengthen the argument for safe LPA-targeted intervention to reduce cardiovascular risk.},

abstract = {This work demonstrates how computational and physical modelling of the positron emission tomography (PET) image acquisition process for a state-of-the-art integrated PET and magnetic resonance imaging (PET-MR) system can produce images comparable to the manufacturer. The GE SIGNA PET/MR scanner is manufactured by General Electric and has time-of-flight (TOF) capabilities of about 390 ps. All software development took place in the Software for Tomographic Image Reconstruction (STIR: http://stir.sf.net) library, which is a widely used open source software to reconstruct data as exported from emission tomography scanners. The new software developments will be integrated into STIR, providing the opportunity for researchers worldwide to establish and expand their image reconstruction methods. Furthermore, this work is of particular significance as it provides the first validation of TOF PET image reconstruction for real scanner datasets using the STIR library. This paper presents the methodology, analysis, and critical issues encountered in implementing an independent reconstruction software package. Acquired PET data were processed via several appropriate algorithms which are necessary to produce an accurate and precise quantitative image. This included mathematical, physical and anatomical modelling of the patient and simulation of various aspects of the acquisition. These included modelling of random coincidences using ‘singles' rates per crystals, detector efficiencies and geometric effects. Attenuation effects were calculated by using the STIR's attenuation correction model. Modelling all these effects within the system matrix allowed the reconstruction of PET images which demonstrates the metabolic uptake of the administered radiopharmaceutical. These implementations were validated using measured phantom and clinical datasets. The developments are tested using the ordered subset expectation maximisation (OSEM) and the more recently proposed kernelised expectation maximisation (KEM) algorithm which incorporates anatomical information from MR images into PET reconstruction.},

To understand the genetic basis of obesity better, here we conduct a genome-wide association study and Metabochip meta-analysis of body mass index (BMI), a measure commonly used to define obesity and assess adiposity, in up to 339,224 individuals. This analysis identifies 97 BMI-associated loci (P {\textless} 5 [times] 10-8), 56 of which are novel. Five loci demonstrate clear evidence of several independent association signals, and many loci have significant effects on other metabolic phenotypes. The 97 loci account for [sim]2.7{\%} of BMI variation, and genome-wide estimates suggest that common variation accounts for {\textgreater}20{\%} of BMI variation. Pathway analyses provide strong support for a role of the central nervous system in obesity susceptibility and implicate new genes and pathways, including those related to synaptic function, glutamate signalling, insulin secretion/action, energy metabolism, lipid biology and adipogenesis.},

abstract = {Mendelian randomization (MR) provides us the opportunity to investigate the causal paths of metabolites in type 2 diabetes and glucose homeostasis. We developed and tested an MR approach based on genetic risk scoring for plasma metabolite levels, utilizing a pathway-based sensitivity analysis to control for nonspecific effects. We focused on 124 circulating metabolites that correlate with fasting glucose in the Erasmus Rucphen Family (ERF) study (n = 2,564) and tested the possible causal effect of each metabolite with glucose and type 2 diabetes and vice versa. We detected 14 paths with potential causal effects by MR, following pathway-based sensitivity analysis. Our results suggest that elevated plasma triglycerides might be partially responsible for increased glucose levels and type 2 diabetes risk, which is consistent with previous reports. Additionally, elevated HDL components, i.e., small HDL triglycerides, might have a causal role of elevating glucose levels. In contrast, large (L) and extra large (XL) HDL lipid components, i.e., XL-HDL cholesterol, XL-HDL–free cholesterol, XL-HDL phospholipids, L-HDL cholesterol, and L-HDL–free cholesterol, as well as HDL cholesterol seem to be protective against increasing fasting glucose but not against type 2 diabetes. Finally, we demonstrate that genetic predisposition to type 2 diabetes associates with increased levels of alanine and decreased levels of phosphatidylcholine alkyl-acyl C42:5 and phosphatidylcholine alkyl-acyl C44:4. Our MR results provide novel insight into promising causal paths to and from glucose and type 2 diabetes and underline the value of additional information from high-resolution metabolomics over classic biochemistry.},

Mendelian randomization (MR) is a method that utilizes genetic variants that are robustly associated with such modifiable exposures to generate more reliable evidence regarding which interventions should produce health benefits. The approach is being widely applied, and various ways to strengthen inference given the known potential limitations of MR are now available. Developments of MR, including two-sample MR, bidirectional MR, network MR, two-step MR, factorial MR and multiphenotype MR, are outlined in this review.

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Obesity is linked to metabolic diseases characterized by insulin resistance, such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease. In this study, we investigated the metabolic disorders of uncomplicated obesity to identify early alterations in biological systems. METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: Metabolic differences between overweight/obese (n=36) and normal-weight (n=35) young Chinese men without known metabolic disorders were assessed. Metabolic profiling of the serum and urine was performed using ultra-performance liquidchromatography quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF-MS). Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) was undertaken to reveal and classify the differences between the two groups. RESULTS: Compared to normal-weight men, obese men had higher levels of the serum metabolites phenylalanine, Phe-Phe, and L-tryptophan, whereas those of p-cresol sulfate and p-cresol were less in obesity. Urinary metabolites phenylacetamide, L-glutamine, phenylacetylglutamine, indoxyl sulfate, p-cresol, and p-cresol sulfate were greater in obese men. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that disorders involving aromatic amino acids and the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) have microbiomic involvement in the uncomplicated phase of obesity.},

abstract = {Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of height and body mass index (BMI) in ∼250000 European participants have led to the discovery of ∼700 and ∼100 nearly independent single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with these traits, respectively. Here we combine summary statistics from those two studies with GWAS of height and BMI performed in ∼450000 UK Biobank participants of European ancestry. Overall, our combined GWAS meta-analysis reaches N ∼700000 individuals and substantially increases the number of GWAS signals associated with these traits. We identified 3290 and 941 near-independent SNPs associated with height and BMI, respectively (at a revised genome-wide significance threshold of P {\textless} 1 × 10-8), including 1185 height-associated SNPs and 751 BMI-associated SNPs located within loci not previously identified by these two GWAS. The near-independent genome-wide significant SNPs explain ∼24.6{\%} of the variance of height and ∼6.0{\%} of the variance of BMI in an independent sample from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). Correlations between polygenic scores based upon these SNPs with actual height and BMI in HRS participants were ∼0.44 and ∼0.22, respectively. From analyses of integrating GWAS and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) data by summary-data-based Mendelian randomization, we identified an enrichment of eQTLs among lead height and BMI signals, prioritizing 610 and 138 genes, respectively. Our study demonstrates that, as previously predicted, increasing GWAS sample sizes continues to deliver, by the discovery of new loci, increasing prediction accuracy and providing additional data to achieve deeper insight into complex trait biology. All summary statistics are made available for follow-up studies.},

abstract = {Abstract A positive association between overweight/obesity and endometrial cancer has been observed. It has been hypothesized that obesity is mostly associated with a subtype described as estrogen-dependent (Type I tumors), constituting about 80{\%} of the endometrial tumors. Few epidemiologic studies have, however, analyzed different histological subtypes separately. The present study aimed at exploring the relations between body size and histological subtypes of cancer of the uterine corpus. Height and weight were measured in over 1 million Norwegian women aged 20?74 during 1963?2001. During follow-up, 9,227 cancers of the uterine corpus were diagnosed. The tumors were classified as Type I tumors (mostly endometrial adenocarcinomas with subgroups), Type II tumors (papillary, serous, and clear cell adenocarcinomas and some poorly differentiated carcinomas), sarcomas, and mixed tumors. Relative risks (RRs) of cancer of the uterine corpus were estimated using Cox proportional hazards regression. Compared with women with normal BMI, overweight and obese women had an overall RR of cancer of the uterine corpus of 1.36 (95{\%} CI: 1.29?1.42) and 2.51 (95{\%} CI: 2.83?2.66). The increase in risk was most pronounced for Type I tumors, but was also seen for Type II tumors, sarcomas and mixed tumors. The overall RR of corpus uteri cancer associated with a 10-cm increase in height was 1.09 (95{\%} CI: 1.05?1.13), and was mostly observed for Type I tumors. ? 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract = {Obesity significantly increases the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, hypertension, coronary heart disease, stroke, fatty liver disease, dementia, obstructive sleep apnea and several types of cancer. Adipocyte and adipose tissue dysfunction represent primary defects in obesity and may link obesity to metabolic and cardiovascular diseases. Adipose tissue (AT) dysfunction manifests by a proinflammatory adipokine secretion pattern that mediate auto/paracrine and endocrine communication and by inflammatory cell infiltration, particularly in intra-abdominal fat. Impaired AT function is caused by the interaction of genetic, behavioral and environmental factors which lead to adipocyte hypertrophy, ectopic fat accumulation, hypoxia, AT stresses, impaired AT mitochondrial function and inflammatory processes within adipose tissue. Recently, increased autophagy has been linked to obesity and AT dysfunction and may represent a mechanism to compensate for AT stresses. A better understanding of mechanisms causing or maintaining AT dysfunction may provide new therapeutic strategies in the treatment of obesity-induced metabolic diseases.},

Information was available on four CRP gene tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs3093077, rs1205, rs1130864, rs1800947), concentration of C reactive protein, and levels of other risk factors.Main outcome measures Risk ratios for coronary heart disease associated with genetically raised C reactive protein versus risk ratios with equivalent differences in C reactive protein concentration itself, adjusted for conventional risk factors and variability in risk factor levels within individuals.Results CRP variants were each associated with up to 30{\%} per allele difference in concentration of C reactive protein (P{\&}lt;10−34) and were unrelated to other risk factors. Risk ratios for coronary heart disease per additional copy of an allele associated with raised C reactive protein were 0.93 (95{\%} confidence interval 0.87 to 1.00) for rs3093077; 1.00 (0.98 to 1.02) for rs1205; 0.98 (0.96 to 1.00) for rs1130864; and 0.99 (0.94 to 1.03) for rs1800947. In a combined analysis, the risk ratio for coronary heart disease was 1.00 (0.90 to 1.13) per 1 SD higher genetically raised natural log (ln) concentration of C reactive protein. The genetic findings were discordant with the risk ratio observed for coronary heart disease of 1.33 (1.23 to 1.43) per 1 SD higher circulating ln concentration of C reactive protein in prospective studies (P=0.001 for difference).Conclusion Human genetic data indicate that C reactive protein concentration itself is unlikely to be even a modest causal factor in coronary heart disease.},

abstract = {One of the reasons for the popularity of meta-analysis is the notion that these analyses will possess more power to detect effects than individual studies. This is inevitably the case under a fixed-effect model. However, the inclusion of the between-study variance in the random-effects model, and the need to estimate this parameter, can have unfortunate implications for this power. We develop methods for assessing the power of random-effects meta-analyses, and the average power of the individual studies that contribute to meta-analyses, so that these powers can be compared. In addition to deriving new analytical results and methods, we apply our methods to 1991 meta-analyses taken from the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews to retrospectively calculate their powers. We find that, in practice, 5 or more studies are needed to reasonably consistently achieve powers from random-effects meta-analyses that are greater than the studies that contribute to them. Not only is statistical inference under the random-effects model challenging when there are very few studies but also less worthwhile in such cases. The assumption that meta-analysis will result in an increase in power is challenged by our findings.},

We found that the BCAAs were correlated with insulin resistance and differentially expressed in obese men, but not in obese women.

abstract = {Summary The relationship between body mass index (BMI) (in midlife and late-life) and dementia was investigated in meta-analyses of 16 articles reporting on 15 prospective studies. Follow-ups ranged from 3.2 to 36.0 years. Meta-analyses were conducted on samples including 25?624 participants evaluated for Alzheimer's disease (AD), 15?435 participants evaluated for vascular dementia (VaD) and 30?470 followed for any type of dementia (Any Dementia). Low BMI in midlife was associated with 1.96 [95{\%} confidence interval (CI): 1.32, 2.92] times the risk of developing AD. The pooled relative risks for AD, VaD and Any Dementia for overweight BMI in midlife compared with normal BMI were 1.35 (95{\%} CI:1.19, 1.54), 1.33 (95{\%} CI: 1.02, 1.75) and 1.26 (95{\%} CI: 1.10, 1.44), respectively. The pooled relative risks of AD and Any Dementia for obese BMI in midlife compared to normal BMI were 2.04 (95{\%} CI: 1.59, 2.62) and 1.64 (95{\%} CI: 1.34, 2.00), respectively. Continuous BMI in late-life was not associated with dementia. Small numbers of studies included in pooled analyses reduce generalizability of findings, and emphasize the need for publication of additional findings. We conclude that underweight, overweight and obesity in midlife increase dementia risk. Further research evaluating late-life BMI and dementia is required.},

When applied to a pair of GWAS, the LD score regression (LDSC) methodology produces a statistic, referred to as the bivariate LDSC intercept, which deviation from 0 is classically interpreted as an indication of sample overlap between the two GWAS. Here we propose an extension of the theory underlying the bivariate LDSC methodology, which accounts for population stratification within and between GWAS. Our extended theory predicts an inflation of the bivariate LDSC intercept when sample sizes and heritability are large, even in the absence of sample overlap. We illustrate our theoretical results with simulations based on actual SNP genotypes and we propose a re-interpretation of previously published results in the light of our extended theory.},

abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To summarize previous and current advancements for leptin therapeutics, we described how leptin may be useful in leptin deficient states such as lipodystrophy, for which leptin was recently approved, and how it may be useful in the future for typical obesity. RECENT FINDINGS: The discovery of leptin in 1994 built the foundation for understanding the pathophysiology and treatment of obesity. Leptin therapy reverses morbid obesity related to congenital leptin deficiency and appears to possibly treat lipodystrophy, a finding which has led to the approval of leptin for the treatment of lipodystrophy in the USA and Japan. Typical obesity, on the other hand, is characterized by hyperleptinemia and leptin tolerance. Thus, leptin administration has proven ineffective for inducing weight loss on its own but could possibly be useful in combination with other therapies or for weight loss maintenance. SUMMARY: Leptin is not able to treat typical obesity; however, it is effective for reversing leptin deficiency-induced obesity and is possibly useful in lipodystrophy. New mechanisms and pathways involved in leptin resistance are continuously discovered, whereas the development of new techniques and drug combinations which may improve leptin's efficacy and safety regenerate the hope for its use as an effective treatment for typical obesity.},

abstract = {Background Blood-based or urinary biomarkers may play a role in quantifying the future risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and in understanding possible aetiological pathways to disease. However, no systematic review has been conducted that has identified and provided an overview of available biomarkers for incident T2D. We aimed to systematically review the associations of biomarkers with risk of developing T2D and to highlight evidence gaps in the existing literature regarding the predictive and aetiological value of these biomarkers and to direct future research in this field. Methods and Findings We systematically searched PubMed MEDLINE (January 2000 until March 2015) and Embase (until January 2016) databases for observational studies of biomarkers and incident T2D according to the 2009 PRISMA guidelines. We also searched availability of meta-analyses, Mendelian randomisation and prediction research for the identified biomarkers. We reviewed 3910 titles (705 abstracts) and 164 full papers and included 139 papers from 69 cohort studies that described the prospective relationships between 167 blood-based or urinary biomarkers and incident T2D. Only 35 biomarkers were reported in large scale studies with more than 1000 T2D cases, and thus the evidence for association was inconclusive for the majority of biomarkers. Fourteen biomarkers have been investigated using Mendelian randomisation approaches. Only for one biomarker was there strong observational evidence of association and evidence from genetic association studies that was compatible with an underlying causal association. In additional search for T2D prediction, we found only half of biomarkers were examined with formal evidence of predictive value for a minority of these biomarkers. Most biomarkers did not enhance the strength of prediction, but the strongest evidence for prediction was for biomarkers that quantify measures of glycaemia. Conclusions This study presents an extensive review of the current state of the literature to inform the strategy for future interrogation of existing and newly described biomarkers for T2D. Many biomarkers have been reported to be associated with the risk of developing T2D. The evidence of their value in adding to understanding of causal pathways to disease is very limited so far. The utility of most biomarkers remains largely unknown in clinical prediction. Future research should focus on providing good genetic instruments across consortia for possible biomarkers in Mendelian randomisation, prioritising biomarkers for measurement in large-scale cohort studies and examining predictive utility of biomarkers for a given context.},

abstract = {The concept of genetic canalization has had an abiding influence on views of complex-trait evolution. A genetically canalized system has evolved to become less sensitive to the effects of mutation. When a gene product that supports canalization is compromised, the phenotypic impacts of a mutation should be more pronounced. This expected increase in mutational effects not only has important consequences for evolution, but has also motivated strategies to treat disease. However, recent studies demonstrate that, when putative agents of genetic canalization are impaired, systems do not behave as expected. Here, we review the evidence that is used to infer whether particular gene products are agents of genetic canalization. Then we explain how such inferences often succumb to a converse error. We go on to show that several candidate agents of genetic canalization increase the phenotypic impacts of some mutations while decreasing the phenotypic impacts of others. These observations suggest that whether a gene product acts as a 'buffer' (lessening mutational effects) or a 'potentiator' (increasing mutational effects) is not a fixed property of the gene product but instead differs for the different mutations with which it interacts. To investigate features of genetic interactions that might predispose them toward buffering versus potentiation, we explore simulated gene-regulatory networks. Similarly to putative agents of genetic canalization, the gene products in simulated networks also modify the phenotypic effects of mutations in other genes without a strong overall tendency towards lessening or increasing these effects. In sum, these observations call into question whether complex traits have evolved to become less sensitive (i.e., are canalized) to genetic change, and the degree to which trends exist that predict how one genetic change might alter another's impact. We conclude by discussing approaches to address these and other open questions that are brought into focus by re-thinking genetic canalization.},

abstract = {To increase our understanding of the genetic basis of adiposity and its links to cardiometabolic disease risk, we conducted a genome-wide association meta-analysis of body fat percentage (BF{\%}) in up to 100,716 individuals. Twelve loci reached genome-wide significance (P{\textless}5 × 10−8), of which eight were previously associated with increased overall adiposity (BMI, BF{\%}) and four (in or near COBLL1/GRB14, IGF2BP1, PLA2G6, CRTC1) were novel associations with BF{\%}. Seven loci showed a larger effect on BF{\%} than on BMI, suggestive of a primary association with adiposity, while five loci showed larger effects on BMI than on BF{\%}, suggesting association with both fat and lean mass. In particular, the loci more strongly associated with BF{\%} showed distinct cross-phenotype association signatures with a range of cardiometabolic traits revealing new insights in the link between adiposity and disease risk.},

abstract = {Summary The study aims to compare anti-obesity interventions in a single evidence synthesis framework. Electronic databases were searched for randomized controlled trials of orlistat, rimonabant or sibutramine reporting weight or body mass index (BMI) change from baseline at 3, 6 or 12 months. A mixed treatment comparison was used to combine direct and indirect trial evidence. Ninety-four studies involving 24,808 individuals were included; 83 trials included data on weight change and 41 on BMI change. All results are in comparison with placebo. The active drugs were all effective at reducing weight and BMI. At 3 months, orlistat reduced weight by ?2.65?kg (95{\%} credibility interval ?4.00?kg, ?1.31?kg). For sibutramine, 15?mg gave a greater reduction than 10?mg at 12 months, ?6.35?kg versus ?5.42?kg, respectively. Rimonabant reduced weight by ?11.23?kg at 3 months and ?4.55?kg at 12 months. Lifestyle advice alone also reduced weight at 6 and 12 months, but was less effective than the pharmacological interventions. In conclusion, modest weight reductions were seen for all pharmacological interventions. Those interventions which have now been withdrawn from use (sibutramine and rimonabant) seem to be the most effective, implying that there may be a place in clinical practice for similar drugs if side effects could be avoided.},

abstract = {Body mass index has a strong relationship to diabetes and insulin resistance. In obese individuals, the amount of nonesterified fatty acids, glycerol, hormones, cytokines, proinflammatory markers, and other substances that are involved in the development of insulin resistance, is increased. The pathogenesis in the development of diabetes is based on the fact that the $\beta$-islet cells of the pancreas are impaired, causing a lack of control of blood glucose. The development of diabetes becomes more inevitable if the failure of $\beta$-islet cells of the pancreas is accompanied by insulin resistance. Weight gain and body mass are central to the formation and rising incidence of type 1 and type 2 diabetes. This literature review will demonstrate the facts that link obesity with insulin resistance and pancreatic $\beta$-cell dysfunction. In conclusion, new approaches in managing and preventing diabetes in obese individuals must be studied and investigated based on the facts.},

abstract = {In the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT), selenium supplementation (causing a median 114 $\mu$g/L increase in circulating selenium) did not lower overall prostate cancer risk, but increased risk of high-grade prostate cancer and type 2 diabetes. Mendelian randomization analysis uses genetic variants to proxy modifiable risk factors and can strengthen causal inference in observational studies. We constructed a genetic instrument comprising 11 single nucleotide polymorphisms robustly (P {\textless} 5 × 10-8) associated with circulating selenium in genome-wide association studies. In a Mendelian randomization analysis of 72 729 men in the PRACTICAL Consortium (44 825 case subjects, 27 904 control subjects), 114 $\mu$g/L higher genetically elevated circulating selenium was not associated with prostate cancer (odds ratio [OR] = 1.01, 95{\%} confidence interval [CI] = 0.89 to 1.13). In concordance with findings from SELECT, selenium was weakly associated with advanced (including high-grade) prostate cancer (OR = 1.21, 95{\%} CI = 0.98 to 1.49) and type 2 diabetes (OR = 1.18, 95{\%} CI = 0.97 to 1.43; in a type 2 diabetes genome-wide association study meta-analysis with up to 49 266 case subjects and 249 906 control subjects). Our Mendelian randomization analyses do not support a role for selenium supplementation in prostate cancer prevention and suggest that supplementation could have adverse effects on risks of advanced prostate cancer and type 2 diabetes.},

As a proportion of the total risk reduction, BMI was estimated to mediate 15{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval 13{\%} to 17{\%}) and 18{\%} (14{\%} to 23{\%}) in the observational and mendelian randomisation estimates, respectively. Corresponding estimates were 11{\%} (9{\%} to 13{\%}) and 21{\%} (15{\%} to 27{\%}) for systolic blood pressure and 19{\%} (15{\%} to 22{\%}) and 34{\%} (17{\%} to 50{\%}) for smoking behaviour. All three risk factors combined were estimated to mediate 42{\%} (36{\%} to 48{\%}) and 36{\%} (5{\%} to 68{\%}) of the effect of education on coronary heart disease in observational and mendelian randomisation analyses, respectively. Similar results were obtained when investigating the risk of stroke, myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular disease.Conclusions BMI, systolic blood pressure, and smoking behaviour mediate a substantial proportion of the protective effect of education on the risk of cardiovascular outcomes and intervening on these would lead to reductions in cases of cardiovascular disease attributable to lower levels of education. However, more than half of the protective effect of education remains unexplained and requires further investigation.},

A genome-wide search for type 2 diabetes-susceptibility genes identified a common variant in the FTO (fat mass and obesity associated) gene that predisposes to diabetes through an effect on body mass index (BMI). An additive association of the variant with BMI was replicated in 13 cohorts with 38,759 participants. The 16{\%} of adults who are homozygous for the risk allele weighed about 3 kilograms more and had 1.67-fold increased odds of obesity when compared with those not inheriting a risk allele. This association was observed from age 7 years upward and reflects a specific increase in fat mass.},

abstract = {Data generated by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are growing fast with the linkage of biobank samples to health records, and expanding capture of high-dimensional molecular phenotypes. However the utility of these efforts can only be fully realised if their complete results are collected from their heterogeneous sources and formats, harmonised and made programmatically accessible.Here we present the OpenGWAS database, an open source, open access, scalable and high-performance cloud-based data infrastructure that imports and publishes complete GWAS summary datasets and metadata for the scientific community. Our import pipeline harmonises these datasets against dbSNP and the human genome reference sequence, generates summary reports and standardises the format of results and metadata. Users can access the data via a website, an application programming interface, R and Python packages, and also as downloadable files that can be rapidly queried in high performance computing environments.OpenGWAS currently contains 126 billion genetic associations from 14,582 complete GWAS datasets representing a range of different human phenotypes and disease outcomes across different populations. We developed R and Python packages to serve as conduits between these GWAS data sources and a range of available analytical tools, enabling Mendelian randomization, genetic colocalisation analysis, fine mapping, genetic correlation and locus visualisation.OpenGWAS is freely accessible at https://gwas.mrcieu.ac.uk, and has been designed to facilitate integration with third party analytical tools.Competing Interest StatementTRG, GH and GDS have received research funding from GlaxoSmithKline and Biogen for projects that use the MRC IEU OpenGWAS database.

Methodological developments in the field allow detecting and/or adjusting for different potential sources of bias, mainly bias due to horizontal pleiotropy (or "off-target" genetic effects). Another potential source of bias is nonrandom matching between spouses (i.e., assortative mating). In this study, we performed simulations to investigate the bias caused in MR by assortative mating. We found that bias can arise due to either cross-trait assortative mating (i.e., assortment on two phenotypes, such as highly educated women selecting taller men) or single-trait assortative mating (i.e., assortment on a single phenotype), even if the exposure and outcome phenotypes are not the phenotypes under assortment. The simulations also indicate that bias due to assortative mating accumulates over generations and that MR methods robust to horizontal pleiotropy are also affected by this bias. Finally, we show that genetic data from mother-father-offspring trios can be used to detect and correct for this bias.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the use of metabolomics for the first-trimester detection of  maternal metabolic dysfunction and prediction of subsequent development of early-onset preeclampsia (PE). STUDY DESIGN: This was a case-control study of maternal plasma samples collected at 11-13 weeks' gestation from 30 women who had subsequently developed PE requiring delivery before 34 weeks and 60 unaffected controls. Nuclear magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was used to identify and quantify metabolomic changes in cases versus controls. Both genetic computing and standard statistical analyses were performed to predict the development of PE from the metabolite concentrations alone as well as the combination of metabolite concentrations with maternal characteristics and first-trimester uterine artery Doppler pulsatility index (PI). RESULTS: Significant differences between cases and controls were found for 20 metabolites. A combination of four of these metabolites (citrate, glycerol, hydroxyisovalerate, and methionine) appeared highly predictive of PE with an estimated detection rate of 75.9{\%}, at a false-positive rate (FPR) of 4.9{\%}. The predictive performance was improved by the addition of uterine artery Doppler PI and fetal crown-rump length (CRL) and with an estimated detection rate of 82.6{\%}, at a FPR of 1.6{\%}. CONCLUSION: A profound change in the first-trimester metabolite profile was noted in women who had subsequently developed early-onset PE. Preliminary algorithms appeared highly sensitive for first trimester prediction of early onset PE.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Circulating amino acids, such as branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) and  aromatic amino acids (AAAs), have been associated with diabetes risk; however, little is known about how a long-term dietary intervention for weight loss affects circulating amino acids. OBJECTIVES: We examined the effects of weight-loss diets on long-term changes in plasma amino acids and the associations of these changes with weight loss and the improvement of insulin resistance. DESIGN: We repeatedly measured plasma amino acid profiles over 2 y in overweight or obese participants from 2 randomized, dietary intervention, weight-loss trials [774 subjects from the POUNDS LOST (Preventing Overweight Using Novel Dietary Strategies Trial) and 318 subjects from the DIRECT (Dietary Intervention Randomized Controlled Trial)]. RESULTS: Intervention diets consistently lowered most of the amino acid concentrations, including BCAAs and AAAs, in both trials. In the POUNDS LOST, average-protein diets (15{\%} of daily energy) showed stronger effects than did high-protein diets (25{\%} of daily energy) on reducing concentrations of the diabetes-associated BCAA valine at 6 mo independent of the weight change. In both trials, weight loss was directly related to the concurrent reduction of the BCAAs leucine and isoleucine, the AAAs tyrosine and phenylalanine, and 4 other amino acids. For example, per kilogram of weight loss, there was a 0.04-SD decrease in log tyrosine (∼0.6 $\mu$mol/L) in both trials. In addition, we showed that reductions in alanine and the AAA tyrosine were significantly related to improved insulin resistance (measured with the use of the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance), independent of weight loss, in both trials (both P {\textless} 0.05). For example, per 1-SD decrease in log tyrosine (∼17 $\mu$mol/L), there was a 0.04-SD (∼3{\%}) improvement in insulin resistance in the POUNDS LOST and a 0.13-SD (∼8{\%}) improvement in insulin resistance in the DIRECT. CONCLUSION: Our findings underscore the potential importance of dietary interventions in improving amino acid profiles (i.e., reducing diabetes risk-enhancing amino acid concentrations) along with and beyond weight loss. The POUNDS LOST and the DIRECT were registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00072995 and NCT00160108, respectively.},

abstract = {Scope: it has been suggested that overweight/obesity as a risk factor for incident dementia differs between mid-life and later life. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the up-to-date current literature to assess this.Search Methods: inclusion criteria included epidemiological longitudinal studies published up to September 2014, in participants without cognitive impairment based on evidence of cognitive assessment and aged 30 or over at baseline assessment with at least 2 years of follow-up. Pubmed, Medline, EMBASE, PsychInfo and the Cochrane Library were searched using combinations of the search terms: Dementia, Alzheimer disease, Vascular Dementia, Multi-Infarct Dementia, Cognitive decline, Cognitive impairment, Mild Cognitive Impairment/Obesity, Overweight, Adiposity, Waist circumference (limits: humans, English language). Handsearching of all papers meeting the inclusion criteria was performed. A random-effects model was used for the meta-analysis.Results: of the 1,612 abstracts identified and reviewed, 21 completely met the inclusion criteria. Being obese below the age of 65 years had a positive association on incident dementia with a risk ratio (RR) 1.41 (95{\%} confidence interval, CI: 1.20–1.66), but the opposite was seen in those aged 65 and over, RR 0.83 (95{\%} CI: 0.74–0.94).Conclusions: this systematic review and meta-analysis suggests a positive association between obesity in mid-life and later dementia but the opposite in late life. Whether weight reduction in mid-life reduces risk is worthy of further study.},

abstract = {Mendelian randomization (MR) provides us the opportunity to investigate the causal paths of metabolites in type 2 diabetes and glucose homeostasis. We developed and tested an MR approach based on genetic risk scoring for plasma metabolite levels, utilizing a pathway-based sensitivity analysis to control for nonspecific effects. We focused on 124 circulating metabolites that correlate with fasting glucose in the Erasmus Rucphen Family (ERF) study (n = 2,564) and tested the possible causal effect of each metabolite with glucose and type 2 diabetes and vice versa. We detected 14 paths with potential causal effects by MR, following pathway-based sensitivity analysis. Our results suggest that elevated plasma triglycerides might be partially responsible for increased glucose levels and type 2 diabetes risk, which is consistent with previous reports. Additionally, elevated HDL components, i.e., small HDL triglycerides, might have a causal role of elevating glucose levels. In contrast, large (L) and extra large (XL) HDL lipid components, i.e., XL-HDL cholesterol, XL-HDL–free cholesterol, XL-HDL phospholipids, L-HDL cholesterol, and L-HDL–free cholesterol, as well as HDL cholesterol seem to be protective against increasing fasting glucose but not against type 2 diabetes. Finally, we demonstrate that genetic predisposition to type 2 diabetes associates with increased levels of alanine and decreased levels of phosphatidylcholine alkyl-acyl C42:5 and phosphatidylcholine alkyl-acyl C44:4. Our MR results provide novel insight into promising causal paths to and from glucose and type 2 diabetes and underline the value of additional information from high-resolution metabolomics over classic biochemistry.},

STUDY DESIGN: Between 1987 and 1990, we conducted a case-control study of 405 women with endometrial cancer and 297 matched population-based controls. This analysis included 174 postmenopausal cases and 136 controls. RESULTS: In logistic regression models adjusted for potential confounders, higher IGF-1 levels were not positively associated with endometrial cancer: odds ratio (OR) for the highest tertile versus the lowest tertile = 0.63, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI) = 0.30-1.32. Endometrial cancer was inversely associated with IGF-2 (OR for the highest tertile = 0.35, 95{\%} CI = 0.18-0.69) and IGFBP-3 (OR for the highest tertile = 0.40, 95{\%} CI = 0.21-0.77), and not associated with IGFBP-1. CONCLUSION: Serum IGF-1, IGF-2, and IGFBP-3, but not IGFBP-1, were inversely associated with endometrial cancer in postmenopausal women. These associations and the potential role of the IGF system in endometrial proliferation and carcinogenesis warrant further research.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Higher adiposity increases the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC), but whether this relationship varies by anatomical sub-site or by sex is unclear. Further, the metabolic alterations mediating the effects of adiposity on CRC are not fully understood. METHODS: We examined sex- and site-specific associations of adiposity with CRC risk and whether adiposity-associated metabolites explain the associations of adiposity with CRC. Genetic variants from genome-wide association studies of body mass index (BMI) and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR, unadjusted for BMI; N = 806,810), and 123 metabolites from targeted nuclear magnetic resonance metabolomics (N = 24,925), were used as instruments. Sex-combined and sex-specific Mendelian randomization (MR) was conducted for BMI and WHR with CRC risk (58,221 cases and 67,694 controls in the Genetics and Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer Consortium, Colorectal Cancer Transdisciplinary Study, and Colon Cancer Family Registry). Sex-combined MR was conducted for BMI and WHR with metabolites, for metabolites with CRC, and for BMI and WHR with CRC adjusted for metabolite classes in multivariable models. RESULTS: In sex-specific MR analyses, higher BMI (per 4.2 kg/m(2)) was associated with 1.23 (95{\%} confidence interval (CI) = 1.08, 1.38) times higher CRC odds among men (inverse-variance-weighted (IVW) model); among women, higher BMI (per 5.2 kg/m(2)) was associated with 1.09 (95{\%} CI = 0.97, 1.22) times higher CRC odds. WHR (per 0.07 higher) was more strongly associated with CRC risk among women (IVW OR = 1.25, 95{\%} CI = 1.08, 1.43) than men (IVW OR = 1.05, 95{\%} CI = 0.81, 1.36). BMI or WHR was associated with 104/123 metabolites at false discovery rate-corrected P ≤ 0.05; several metabolites were associated with CRC, but not in directions that were consistent with the mediation of positive adiposity-CRC relations. In multivariable MR analyses, associations of BMI and WHR with CRC were not attenuated following adjustment for representative metabolite classes, e.g., the univariable IVW OR for BMI with CRC was 1.12 (95{\%} CI = 1.00, 1.26), and this became 1.11 (95{\%} CI = 0.99, 1.26) when adjusting for cholesterol in low-density lipoprotein particles. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that higher BMI more greatly raises CRC risk among men, whereas higher WHR more greatly raises CRC risk among women. Adiposity was associated with numerous metabolic alterations, but none of these explained associations between adiposity and CRC. More detailed metabolomic measures are likely needed to clarify the mechanistic pathways.},

abstract = {Abstract Objective: The Tanita TBF-305 body fat analyzer is marketed for home and clinical use and is based on the principles of leg-to-leg bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). Few studies have investigated the ability of leg-to-leg BIA to detect change in percentage fat mass ({\%}FM) over time. Our objective was to determine the ability of leg-to-leg BIA vs. the four-compartment (4C) model to detect small changes in {\%}FM in overweight adults. Research Methods and Procedures: Thirty-eight overweight adults (BMI, 25.0 to 29.9 kg/m2; age, 18 to 44 years; 31 women) participated in a 6-month, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of a nutritional supplement. Body composition was measured at 0 and 6 months using the Tanita TBF-305 body fat analyzer [using equations derived by the manufacturer ({\%}FMT-Man) and by Jebb et al. ({\%}FMT-Jebb)] and the 4C model ({\%}FM4C). Results: Subjects in the experimental group lost 0.9{\%}FM4C (p = 0.03), a loss that did not reach significance using leg-to-leg BIA (0.6{\%}FMT-Man, p = 0.151; 0.6{\%}FMT-Jebb, p = 0.144). We observed large standard deviations (SDs) in the mean difference in {\%}FM between the 4C model and the TanitaManufacturer (2.5{\%}) and TanitaJebb (2.2{\%}). Ten subjects fell outside ±1 SD of the mean differences at 0 and 6 months; those individuals were younger and shorter than those within ±1 SD. Discussion: Leg-to-leg BIA performed reasonably well in predicting decreases in {\%}FM in this group of overweight adults but resulted in wide SDs vs. {\%}FM4C in individuals. Cross-sectional determinations of {\%}FM of overweight individuals using leg-to-leg BIA should be interpreted with caution.},

These analyses used height effect estimates from the GIANT consortium and replication studies. Here, we describe a new analysis based on the the UK Biobank (UKB), a large, independent dataset. We find that the signals of selection using UKB effect estimates are strongly attenuated or absent. We also provide evidence that previous analyses were confounded by population stratification. Therefore, the conclusion of strong polygenic adaptation now lacks support. Moreover, these discrepancies highlight (1) that methods for correcting for population stratification in GWAS may not always be sufficient for polygenic trait analyses, and (2) that claims of differences in polygenic scores between populations should be treated with caution until these issues are better understood.

We investigated the effects of changes in body fat percentage (BFP) on the longitudinal changes in the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in the elderly. This prospective cohort study included 390 participants aged {\textgreater}65 years who underwent bioelectrical impedance analysis at baseline and follow-up as a part of the Korean Longitudinal Study on Health and Aging. After a median follow-up period of 5.3 years, BFP was significantly higher than that at the start point (P{\textless}0.05). Participants who had the largest increase in BFP had the highest BMI and waist circumference (WC) (P{\textless}0.001). The highest tertile had the highest white blood cell count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, incidence of rapid progression, and decline in eGFR {\textgreater}25{\%} (P≤0.017, P = 0.025, P = 0.005, respectively). The lowest tertile had the lowest triglyceride and highest high-density lipoprotein levels (P{\textless}0.05). The adjusted decline rate in eGFR was correlated with a change in BFP (P = 0.039), but not with that in BMI or WC. The highest tertile had a 4.875-fold increase in the risk for rapid progression to a decline in eGFR (95{\%} CI: 1.366-17.397) and a 4.931-fold decrease in the risk to a decline in eGFR{\textgreater}25{\%} (95{\%} CI: 1.617-15.037), when compared with the lowest tertile. In subgroup analysis, the incidence of renal outcomes was significantly increased according to the increase in BFP in patients with lower eGFR (P≤0.010). A change in BFP may be associated with inflammation and dyslipidemia development, and longitudinal changes in body fat are related to a decrease in eGFR in the elderly.},

abstract = {Background: Obesity is becoming a serious public health issue and is related to lung dysfunction. Because both weight and height are indicators of body size, body mass index (BMI) may not be an ideal index of obesity in prediction of pulmonary dysfunction.Objective: The objective of the study was to determine the predictability of waist circumference (WC) and BMI for pulmonary function in adults with and without excess body weight.Design: A cross-sectional study of 1674 adults aged ≥18 y was conducted in a rural community. Height, weight, WC, and pulmonary function were measured. Multivariate analysis was conducted.Results: WC was negatively associated with forced vital capacity and forced expiratory volume in 1 s, and the associations were consistent across sex, age, and BMI categories. On average, a 1-cm increase in WC was associated with a 13-mL reduction in forced vital capacity and an 11-mL reduction in forced expiratory volume in 1 s. The association between WC and pulmonary function was consistent in subjects with normal weight, overweight, and obesity. In subjects with normal weight, BMI was positively associated with forced vital capacity and forced expiratory volume in 1 s.Conclusion: WC, but not BMI, is negatively and consistently associated with pulmonary function in normal-weight, overweight, and obese subjects.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to identify metabolomic markers in  maternal first-trimester serum for the detection of fetal congenital heart defects (CHDs). STUDY DESIGN: Mass spectrometry (direct injection/liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry) and nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry-based metabolomic analyses were performed between 11 weeks' and 13 weeks 6 days' gestation on maternal serum. A total of 27 CHD cases and 59 controls were compared. There were no known or suspected chromosomal or syndromic abnormalities indicated. RESULTS: A total of 174 metabolites were identified and quantified using the 2 analytical methods. There were 14 overlapping metabolites between platforms. We identified 123 metabolites that demonstrated significant differences on a univariate analysis in maternal first-trimester serum in CHD vs normal cases. There was a significant disturbance in acylcarnitine, sphingomyelin, and other metabolite levels in CHD pregnancies. Predictive algorithms were developed for CHD detection. High sensitivity (0.929; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 0.92-1.00) and specificity (0.932; 95{\%} CI, 0.78-1.00) for CHD detection were achieved (area under the curve, 0.992; 95{\%} CI, 0.973-1.0). CONCLUSION: In the first such report, we demonstrated the feasibility of the use of metabolomic developing biomarkers for the first-trimester prediction of CHD. Abnormal lipid metabolism appeared to be a significant feature of CHD pregnancies.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Although metabolic profiles have been associated with chronic disease risk, lack of temporal stability of metabolite levels could limit their use in epidemiological investigations. The present study aims to evaluate the reliability over a two-year period of 158 metabolites and compare reliability over time in fasting and non-fasting serum samples. METHODS: Metabolites were measured with the AbsolueIDQp180 kit (Biocrates, Innsbruck, Austria) by mass spectrometry and included acylcarnitines, amino acids, biogenic amines, hexoses, phosphatidylcholines and sphingomyelins. Measurements were performed on repeat serum samples collected two years apart in 27 fasting men from Turin, Italy, and 39 non-fasting women from Utrecht, The Netherlands, all participating in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study. Reproducibility was assessed by estimating intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) in multivariable mixed models. RESULTS: In fasting samples, a median ICC of 0.70 was observed. ICC values were {\textless}0.50 for 48{\%} of amino acids, 27{\%} of acylcarnitines, 18{\%} of lysophosphatidylcholines and 4{\%} of phosphatidylcholines. In non-fasting samples, the median ICC was 0.54. ICC values were {\textless}0.50 for 71{\%} of acylcarnitines, 48{\%} of amino acids, 44{\%} of biogenic amines, 36{\%} of sphingomyelins, 34{\%} of phosphatidylcholines and 33{\%} of lysophosphatidylcholines. Overall, reproducibility was lower in non-fasting as compared to fasting samples, with a statistically significant difference for 19-36{\%} of acylcarnitines, phosphatidylcholines and sphingomyelins. CONCLUSION: A single measurement per individual may be sufficient for the study of 73{\%} and 52{\%} of the metabolites showing ICCs {\textgreater}0.50 in fasting and non-fasting samples, respectively. ICCs were higher in fasting samples that are preferable to non-fasting.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The relationship between central obesity and survival in community-dwelling adults with normal body mass index (BMI) is not well-known. OBJECTIVE: To examine total and cardiovascular mortality risks associated with central obesity and normal BMI. DESIGN: Stratified multistage probability design. SETTING: NHANES III (Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey). PARTICIPANTS: 15,184 adults (52.3{\%} women) aged 18 to 90 years. MEASUREMENTS: Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate the relationship of obesity patterns defined by BMI and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) and total and cardiovascular mortality risk after adjustment for confounding factors. RESULTS: Persons with normal-weight central obesity had the worst long-term survival. For example, a man with a normal BMI (22 kg/m2) and central obesity had greater total mortality risk than one with similar BMI but no central obesity (hazard ratio [HR], 1.87 [95{\%} CI, 1.53 to 2.29]), and this man had twice the mortality risk of participants who were overweight or obese according to BMI only (HR, 2.24 [CI, 1.52 to 3.32] and 2.42 [CI, 1.30 to 4.53], respectively). Women with normal-weight central obesity also had a higher mortality risk than those with similar BMI but no central obesity (HR, 1.48 [CI, 1.35 to 1.62]) and those who were obese according to BMI only (HR, 1.32 [CI, 1.15 to 1.51]). Expected survival estimates were consistently lower for those with central obesity when age and BMI were controlled for. LIMITATIONS: Body fat distribution was assessed based on anthropometric indicators alone. Information on comorbidities was collected by self-report. CONCLUSION: Normal-weight central obesity defined by WHR is associated with higher mortality than BMI-defined obesity, particularly in the absence of central fat distribution.

abstract = {The relationship between obesity and cognitive impairment is important given the globally ageing population in whom cognitive decline and neurodegenerative disorders will carry grave individual, societal and financial burdens. This review examines the evidence for the link between obesity and cognitive function in terms of both the immediate effects on cognitive performance, and effects on the trajectory of cognitive ageing and likelihood of dementia. In mid-life, there is a strong association between obesity and impaired cognitive function. Anthropometric measures of obesity are also associated with reduced neural integrity (e.g. grey and white matter atrophy). Increasing age coupled with the negative metabolic consequences of obesity (e.g. type 2 diabetes mellitus) are likely to significantly contribute to cognitive decline and incidence of dementia. Stress is identified as a potential risk factor promoting abdominal obesity and contributing to impaired cognitive function. However, the potentially protective effects of obesity against cognitive decline in older age require further examination. Finally, surgical and whole diet interventions, which address obesity may improve cognitive capacity and confer some protection against later cognitive decline. In conclusion, obesity and its comorbidities are associated with impaired cognitive performance, accelerated cognitive decline and neurodegenerative pathologies such as dementia in later life. Interventions targeting mid-life obesity may prove beneficial in reducing the cognitive risks associated with obesity.},

abstract = {Type 2 diabetes and obesity often coexist, so it is difficult to judge whether diabetes or obesity induce certain types of hyperlipidemia due to mutual confounds and reverse causation. We used Mendelian randomization analyses to explore the causal relationships of diabetes and adiposity with lipid profiles.From 23 sites in East China, 9798 participants were enrolled during 2014 to 2016. We calculated two weighted genetic risk scores as instrumental variables for type 2 diabetes and body mass index (BMI). These scores were used to measure the causal relationships of diabetes and BMI with lipid profiles that included total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and triglycerides (TGs).The causal regression coefficients ($\beta$IV) of genetically determined diabetes for the total cholesterol, LDL-C, and log10TG were 0.130 [95{\%} confidence interval (CI): 0.020, 0.240; P = 0.014], 0.125 (96{\%} CI: 0.041, 0.209; P = 0.001), and 0.019 (95{\%} CI: –0.001, 0.039; P = 0.055), respectively. The $\beta$IV for HDL-C was –0.008 (95{\%} CI: –0.032. 0.016), which was not significant (P = 0.699). The causal regression coefficients of a genetically determined 10 kg/m2 increase in BMI for HDL-C and log10TG were –0.409 (96{\%} CI: –0.698, –0.120; P = 0.004) and 0.227 (95{\%} CI: 0.039, 0.415; P = 0.026), respectively. The $\beta$IVs for TGs and LDL-C were not significant.This study has provided evidence for the biologically plausible causal effects of diabetes and adiposity by BMI on different elements of the lipid profile using Mendelian randomization analyses.},

abstract = {Obesity significantly increases the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, hypertension, coronary heart disease, stroke, fatty liver disease, dementia, obstructive sleep apnea and several types of cancer. Adipocyte and adipose tissue dysfunction represent primary defects in obesity and may link obesity to metabolic and cardiovascular diseases. Adipose tissue (AT) dysfunction manifests by a proinflammatory adipokine secretion pattern that mediate auto/paracrine and endocrine communication and by inflammatory cell infiltration, particularly in intra-abdominal fat. Impaired AT function is caused by the interaction of genetic, behavioral and environmental factors which lead to adipocyte hypertrophy, ectopic fat accumulation, hypoxia, AT stresses, impaired AT mitochondrial function and inflammatory processes within adipose tissue. Recently, increased autophagy has been linked to obesity and AT dysfunction and may represent a mechanism to compensate for AT stresses. A better understanding of mechanisms causing or maintaining AT dysfunction may provide new therapeutic strategies in the treatment of obesity-induced metabolic diseases.},

abstract = {Summary Background The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2017 comparative risk assessment (CRA) is a comprehensive approach to risk factor quantification that offers a useful tool for synthesising evidence on risks and risk–outcome associations. With each annual GBD study, we update the GBD CRA to incorporate improved methods, new risks and risk–outcome pairs, and new data on risk exposure levels and risk–outcome associations. Methods We used the CRA framework developed for previous iterations of GBD to estimate levels and trends in exposure, attributable deaths, and attributable disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), by age group, sex, year, and location for 84 behavioural, environmental and occupational, and metabolic risks or groups of risks from 1990 to 2017. This study included 476 risk–outcome pairs that met the GBD study criteria for convincing or probable evidence of causation. We extracted relative risk and exposure estimates from 46 749 randomised controlled trials, cohort studies, household surveys, census data, satellite data, and other sources. We used statistical models to pool data, adjust for bias, and incorporate covariates. Using the counterfactual scenario of theoretical minimum risk exposure level (TMREL), we estimated the portion of deaths and DALYs that could be attributed to a given risk. We explored the relationship between development and risk exposure by modelling the relationship between the Socio-demographic Index (SDI) and risk-weighted exposure prevalence and estimated expected levels of exposure and risk-attributable burden by SDI. Finally, we explored temporal changes in risk-attributable DALYs by decomposing those changes into six main component drivers of change as follows: (1) population growth; (2) changes in population age structures; (3) changes in exposure to environmental and occupational risks; (4) changes in exposure to behavioural risks; (5) changes in exposure to metabolic risks; and (6) changes due to all other factors, approximated as the risk-deleted death and DALY rates, where the risk-deleted rate is the rate that would be observed had we reduced the exposure levels to the TMREL for all risk factors included in GBD 2017. Findings In 2017, 34{\textperiodcentered}1 million (95{\%} uncertainty interval [UI] 33{\textperiodcentered}3–35{\textperiodcentered}0) deaths and 1{\textperiodcentered}21 billion (1{\textperiodcentered}14–1{\textperiodcentered}28) DALYs were attributable to GBD risk factors. Globally, 61{\textperiodcentered}0{\%} (59{\textperiodcentered}6–62{\textperiodcentered}4) of deaths and 48{\textperiodcentered}3{\%} (46{\textperiodcentered}3–50{\textperiodcentered}2) of DALYs were attributed to the GBD 2017 risk factors. When ranked by risk-attributable DALYs, high systolic blood pressure (SBP) was the leading risk factor, accounting for 10{\textperiodcentered}4 million (9{\textperiodcentered}39–11{\textperiodcentered}5) deaths and 218 million (198–237) DALYs, followed by smoking (7{\textperiodcentered}10 million [6{\textperiodcentered}83–7{\textperiodcentered}37] deaths and 182 million [173–193] DALYs), high fasting plasma glucose (6{\textperiodcentered}53 million [5{\textperiodcentered}23–8{\textperiodcentered}23] deaths and 171 million [144–201] DALYs), high body-mass index (BMI; 4{\textperiodcentered}72 million [2{\textperiodcentered}99–6{\textperiodcentered}70] deaths and 148 million [98{\textperiodcentered}6–202] DALYs), and short gestation for birthweight (1{\textperiodcentered}43 million [1{\textperiodcentered}36–1{\textperiodcentered}51] deaths and 139 million [131–147] DALYs). In total, risk-attributable DALYs declined by 4{\textperiodcentered}9{\%} (3{\textperiodcentered}3–6{\textperiodcentered}5) between 2007 and 2017. In the absence of demographic changes (ie, population growth and ageing), changes in risk exposure and risk-deleted DALYs would have led to a 23{\textperiodcentered}5{\%} decline in DALYs during that period. Conversely, in the absence of changes in risk exposure and risk-deleted DALYs, demographic changes would have led to an 18{\textperiodcentered}6{\%} increase in DALYs during that period. The ratios of observed risk exposure levels to exposure levels expected based on SDI (O/E ratios) increased globally for unsafe drinking water and household air pollution between 1990 and 2017. This result suggests that development is occurring more rapidly than are changes in the underlying risk structure in a population. Conversely, nearly universal declines in O/E ratios for smoking and alcohol use indicate that, for a given SDI, exposure to these risks is declining. In 2017, the leading Level 4 risk factor for age-standardised DALY rates was high SBP in four super-regions: central Europe, eastern Europe, and central Asia; north Africa and Middle East; south Asia; and southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania. The leading risk factor in the high-income super-region was smoking, in Latin America and Caribbean was high BMI, and in sub-Saharan Africa was unsafe sex. O/E ratios for unsafe sex in sub-Saharan Africa were notably high, and those for alcohol use in north Africa and the Middle East were notably low. Interpretation By quantifying levels and trends in exposures to risk factors and the resulting disease burden, this assessment offers insight into where past policy and programme efforts might have been successful and highlights current priorities for public health action. Decreases in behavioural, environmental, and occupational risks have largely offset the effects of population growth and ageing, in relation to trends in absolute burden. Conversely, the combination of increasing metabolic risks and population ageing will probably continue to drive the increasing trends in non-communicable diseases at the global level, which presents both a public health challenge and opportunity. We see considerable spatiotemporal heterogeneity in levels of risk exposure and risk-attributable burden. Although levels of development underlie some of this heterogeneity, O/E ratios show risks for which countries are overperforming or underperforming relative to their level of development. As such, these ratios provide a benchmarking tool to help to focus local decision making. Our findings reinforce the importance of both risk exposure monitoring and epidemiological research to assess causal connections between risks and health outcomes, and they highlight the usefulness of the GBD study in synthesising data to draw comprehensive and robust conclusions that help to inform good policy and strategic health planning.

abstract = {Most, but not all, studies report a positive association between birth weight, as an indirect marker of prenatal hormone exposure, and offspring breast cancer risk, particularly premenopausal breast cancer. Females from opposite-sexed twin pairs may also be prenatally exposed to androgens from their twin brothers. A Swedish study of opposite-sexed twins with a small sample size found a very strong positive association between female birth weight and breast cancer risk. In this case–control study, nested within a cohort of female opposite-sexed twins, we included 543 breast cancer case subjects diagnosed in the period from 1972 to 2008 and 2715 matched control subjects. Conditional logistic regression estimated the breast cancer risk associated with birth weight and other birth characteristics, including gestational age and co-twin birth weight. All statistical tests were two-sided. There was no association between birth weight (odds ratio = 1.01; 95{\%} confidence interval = 0.70 to 1.46) or twin brother's birth weight and risk of breast cancer, which suggests the previously reported strong positive association may have been a chance finding.},

Understanding the causal connections between these phenotypes and variation in metabolite levels can uncover relevant biology and inform novel intervention strategies. Recent studies have combined metabolite profiling with genetic instrumental variable (IV) analysis (Mendelian randomization) to infer the direction of causality between metabolites and obesity, but often omitted a large portion of untargeted profiling data consisting of unknown, unidentified metabolite signals.},

abstract = {Background Body mass index (BMI) is correlated negatively with subjective well-being and positively with depressive symptoms. Whether these associations reflect causal effects is unclear.Methods We examined bidirectional, causal effects between BMI and mental health with Mendelian randomisation using summary-level data from published genome-wide association studies (BMI: n=339 224; subjective well-being: n=204 966; depressive symptoms: n=161 460). Genetic variants robustly related to the exposure variable acted as instrumental variable to estimate causal effects. We combined estimates of individual genetic variants with inverse-variance weighted meta-analysis, weighted median regression and MR-Egger regression.Results There was evidence for a causal, increasing effect of BMI on depressive symptoms and suggestive evidence for a decreasing effect of BMI on subjective well-being. We found no evidence for causality in the other direction.Conclusion This study provides support for a higher BMI causing poorer mental health. Further research should corroborate these findings and explore mechanisms underlying this potential causality.},

@article{Ong2004,
abstract = {AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Type 2 diabetes risk is associated with low birth weight, rapid weight gain during childhood, and shorter stature and lower circulating IGF-I levels in adults. The largest variations in growth rates occur during the first postnatal years. We hypothesised that early postnatal variations in height and weight gain and IGF-I levels may be associated with risk markers for adult disease. METHODS: We measured the fasting insulin sensitivity (Homeostasis model) and insulin secretion post-oral glucose (insulinogenic index 0-30 min) in 851 normal 8-year-old children from a prospective birth cohort. We examined associations between size at birth, postnatal weight gain and circulating IGF-I levels with insulin sensitivity and secretion at 8 years of age. RESULTS: Fasting insulin sensitivity at 8 years was closely related to current BMI (r= -0.33, p{\textless}0.0005). Lower insulin sensitivity and higher BMI and waist circumference were all predicted by greater weight gain between birth to 3 years of age (all p{\textless}0.0005); lower birth weight was associated with reduced insulin sensitivity only in the highest current BMI tertile ( r=0.17, p=0.006). In contrast, lower insulin secretion was related to smaller size at birth ( p=0.01), independent of postnatal weight gain and insulin sensitivity. Lower insulin secretion was also independently related to shorter stature at 8 years of age relative to parental height ( p=0.047) and with lower plasma IGF-I levels at 5 years of age ( n=252, p=0.004). CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Associations between lower birth weight and insulin resistance may be dependent on rapid weight gain during the early postnatal years. However, irrespective of postnatal weight gain, smaller size at birth, lower IGF-I levels and lower childhood height predicted reduced compensatory insulin secretion.},
