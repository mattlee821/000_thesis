Increased adipose tissue, adiposity, is associated with many diseases and overall mortality. This thesis aimed to identify whether metabolites are intermediates in these associations using a variety of resources and methods to strengthen causal inference. \par

In a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis (Chapter \@ref(systematic-review)), the causal effects of adiposity were observed across a broad spectrum of diseases, including endometrial cancer which was selected for subsequent analysis. These results were supported by a narrative synthesis of over 2,000 MR analyses, which also highlighted evidence of an association between adiposity and many, predominantly lipid, metabolites. \par

Within the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), evidence for a consistent effect of body mass index (BMI), waist hip ratio (WHR), and body fat percentage (BF) on up-to 230, predominantly lipid, metabolites was found (Chapter \@ref(observational)). In these linear models, the effect of adiposity persisted after adjustment for covariates and across multiple time points (~9, ~18, ~24, ~50 years old). \par

In two independent datasets, Mendelian randomization (MR), which can overcome limitations in observational analyses, provided further evidence for an effect of BMI and WHR on up-to 230, predominantly lipid, metabolites (Chapter \@ref(MR)). These effects were consistent in sensitivity analyses. The effect of BF on metabolites was, unlike in observational analyses, broadly opposite to the effects of BMI and WHR. \par

Evidence from observational and MR analyses identified 56 adiposity-associated metabolites. Two of these (triglycerides in small and very small VLDL) were associated with endometrial cancer in MR analysis and selected for intermediate analysis (Chapter \@ref(mediation)). When comparing multivariable and univariable MR estimates, there was evidence for a potential intermediary role of both metabolites on the effect of WHR and BF, but not BMI, on non-endometrioid cancer. Weak instruments may have biased these results however. \par
