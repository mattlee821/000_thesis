All of the work in Chapters \@ref(introduction), \@ref(observational), \@ref(MR), and \@ref(mediation) is solely mine. Work presented in Chapters \@ref(systematic-review), \@ref(visualisation), and \@ref(mediation) involved a number of collaborations, however these projects were led by myself and the presentation of this within the Chapters is solely mine. Specifically, I lead all of the work in Chapter \@ref(systematic-review), which was conducted in collaboration with Charlie Hatcher, Luke A McGuinness, Nancy McBride, Thomas Battram, Si Fang, Wenxin Wan, and Kaitlin H Wade who all contributed to data extraction. I also performed data extraction and, in collaboration with Charlie Hatcher, checked all extracted data for all included studies. I performed all analyses in Chapter \@ref(systematic-review). In Chapter \@ref(visualisation), work was conducted in collaboration with Osama Mahmoud and Luke A McGuinness. I worked with Osama to develop the code that would form the original draft of the visualisation tool, `EpiViz`. Luke McGuinness helped with aspects of the `Shiny` application. The following colleagues provided feedback in the development of `EpiViz`: Caroline Bull, Charlie Hatcher, Kurt Taylor, Nancy Mcbride, Neil Goulding, and Steph Suddell. Work from Chapter \@ref(visualisation) is published open source on [GitHub](https://github.com/mattlee821/EpiViz) and is presented for the first time in Bos et al. (2020)[@Bos2021]. Vanessa Tan and Caroline Bull shared multivariable Mendelian randomization (MVMR) scripts with me, which I then used for reference in my analyses in Chapter \@ref(mediation). Eleanor Sanderson provided helpful guidance and feedback on the interpretation of MVMR results in Chapter \@ref(mediation). \par
