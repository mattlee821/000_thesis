This thesis is a result of the support and effort that has been given to me and is undoubtedly a better piece of work because of this. I can only hope that I am able to support and give as much as has been given to me in the years to come. Nic/Kaitlin/Laura, thanks for putting up with my shit and just being great fun to work with! David/Vanessa/Caroline/Sam, thanks for being patient and helping me with stupid questions. Emma, thanks so much for getting me out of the lab! \par
