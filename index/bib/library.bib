abstract = {Have you noticed when you browse a book, journal, study report, or product label how your eye is drawn to figures more than to words and tables? Statistical graphs are powerful ways to transparently and succinctly communicate the key points of medical research. Furthermore, the graphic design itself adds to the clarity of the messages in the data. The goal of this paper is to provide a mechanism for selecting the appropriate graph to thoughtfully construct quality deliverables using good graphic design principles. Examples are motivated by the efforts of a Safety Graphics Working Group that consisted of scientists from the pharmaceutical industry, Food and Drug Administration, and academic institutions.

abstract = {Background: Anthropometric measures such as the body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference are widely used as convenient indices of adiposity, yet there are limitations in their estimates of body fat. We aimed to determine the prevalence of obesity using criteria based on the BMI and waist circumference, and to examine the relationship between the BMI and body fat. Methodology/Principal Findings: This population-based, cross-sectional study was conducted as part of the Geelong Osteoporosis Study. A random sample of 1,467 men and 1,076 women aged 20-96 years was assessed 2001-2008. Overweight and obesity were identified according to BMI (overweight 25.0-29.9 kg/m 2; obesity ≥30.0 kg/m 2) and waist circumference (overweight men 94.0-101.9 cm; women 80.0-87.9 cm; obesity men ≥102.0 cm, women ≥88.0 cm); body fat mass was assessed using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry; height and weight were measured and lifestyle factors documented by self-report. According to the BMI, 45.1{\%} (95{\%}CI 42.4-47.9) of men and 30.2{\%} (95{\%}CI 27.4-33.0) of women were overweight and a further 20.2{\%} (95{\%}CI 18.0-22.4) of men and 28.6{\%} (95{\%}CI 25.8-31.3) of women were obese. Using waist circumference, 27.5{\%} (95{\%}CI 25.1-30.0) of men and 23.3{\%} (95{\%}CI 20.8-25.9) of women were overweight, and 29.3{\%} (95{\%}CI 26.9-31.7) of men and 44.1{\%} (95{\%}CI 41.2-47.1) of women, obese. Both criteria indicate that approximately 60{\%} of the population exceeded recommended thresholds for healthy body habitus. There was no consistent pattern apparent between BMI and energy intake. Compared with women, BMI overestimated adiposity in men, whose excess weight was largely attributable to muscular body builds and greater bone mass. BMI also underestimated adiposity in the elderly. Regression models including gender, age and BMI explained 0.825 of the variance in percent body fat. Conclusions/Significance: As the BMI does not account for differences in body composition, we suggest that gender- and age-specific thresholds should be considered when the BMI is used to indicate adiposity. {\textcopyright} 2012 Pasco et al.},

abstract = {Metabolomics, the systematic investigation of all metabolites present within a biologic system, is used in biomarker development for many human diseases, including cancer. In this review, we investigate the current role of mass spectrometry-based metabolomics in cancer research. A literature review was carried out within the databases PubMed, Embase, and Web of Knowledge. We included 106 studies reporting on 21 different types of cancer in 7 different sample types. Metabolomics in cancer research is most often used for case-control comparisons. Secondary applications include translational areas, such as patient prognosis, therapy control and tumor classification, or grading. Metabolomics is at a developmental stage with respect to epidemiology, with the majority of studies including less than 100 patients. Standardization is required especially concerning sample preparation and data analysis. In the second part of this review, we reconstructed a metabolic network of patients with cancer by quantitatively extracting all reports of altered metabolites: Alterations in energy metabolism, membrane, and fatty acid synthesis emerged, with tryptophan levels changed most frequently in various cancers. Metabolomics has the potential to evolve into a standard tool for future applications in epidemiology and translational cancer research, but further, large-scale studies including prospective validation are needed.},

abstract = {Obesity significantly increases the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, hypertension, coronary heart disease, stroke, fatty liver disease, dementia, obstructive sleep apnea and several types of cancer. Adipocyte and adipose tissue dysfunction represent primary defects in obesity and may link obesity to metabolic and cardiovascular diseases. Adipose tissue (AT) dysfunction manifests by a proinflammatory adipokine secretion pattern that mediate auto/paracrine and endocrine communication and by inflammatory cell infiltration, particularly in intra-abdominal fat. Impaired AT function is caused by the interaction of genetic, behavioral and environmental factors which lead to adipocyte hypertrophy, ectopic fat accumulation, hypoxia, AT stresses, impaired AT mitochondrial function and inflammatory processes within adipose tissue. Recently, increased autophagy has been linked to obesity and AT dysfunction and may represent a mechanism to compensate for AT stresses. A better understanding of mechanisms causing or maintaining AT dysfunction may provide new therapeutic strategies in the treatment of obesity-induced metabolic diseases.},

abstract = {Background: Body mass index (BMI) is criticized for not distinguishing fat from lean mass and ignoring fat distribution, leaving its ability to detect health effects unclear. Objectives: The aim of this study was to compare BMI with total and regional fat indexes from dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry in their associations with cardiometabolic traits. Duration of exposure to and change in each index across adolescence were examined in relation to detailed traits in young adulthood. Methods: BMI was examined alongside total, trunk, arm, and leg fat indexes (each in kilograms per square meter) from dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry at ages 10 and 18 years in relation to 230 traits from targeted metabolomics at age 18 years in 2,840 offspring from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. Results: Higher total fat mass index and BMI at age 10 years were similarly associated with cardiometabolic traits at age 18 years, including higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure, higher very low-density lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, higher triglycerides, and higher insulin and glycoprotein acetyls. Associations were stronger for both indexes measured at age 18 years and for gains in each index from age 10 to 18 years (e.g., 0.45 SDs [95{\%} confidence interval: 0.38 to 0.53] in glycoprotein acetyls per SD unit gain in fat mass index vs. 0.38 SDs [95{\%} confidence interval: 0.27 to 0.48] per SD unit gain in BMI). Associations resembled those for trunk fat index. Higher lean mass index was weakly associated with traits and was not protective against higher fat mass index. Conclusions: The results of this study support abdominal fatness as a primary driver of cardiometabolic dysfunction and BMI as a useful tool for detecting its effects.},

Metabolomics experiments often results in discovery studies that provide intriguing biological hypotheses but rarely offer mechanistic explanation of such findings. In this light, the interpretation of metabolomics data can be boosted by deploying systems biology approaches. OBJECTIVES: This review aims to provide an overview of systems biology approaches that are relevant to metabolomics and to discuss some successful applications of these methods. METHODS: We review the most recent applications of systems biology tools in the field of metabolomics, such as network inference and analysis, metabolic modelling and pathways analysis. RESULTS: We offer an ample overview of systems biology tools that can be applied to address metabolomics problems. The characteristics and application results of these tools are discussed also in a comparative manner. CONCLUSIONS: Systems biology-enhanced analysis of metabolomics data can provide insights into the molecular mechanisms originating the observed metabolic profiles and enhance the scientific impact of metabolomics studies.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The built environment might be associated with development of obesity and related disorders. We examined whether neighbourhood exposure to fast-food outlets and physical activity facilities were associated with adiposity in UK adults. METHODS: We used cross-sectional observational data from UK Biobank. Participants were aged 40-70 years and attended 21 assessment centres between 2006 and 2010. Using linked data on environments around each participant's residential address, we examined whether density of physical activity facilities and proximity to fast-food outlets were associated with waist circumference, body-mass index (BMI), and body fat percentage. We used multilevel linear regression models adjusted for potential confounders, and conducted several sensitivity analyses. FINDINGS: Complete case sample sizes were 401 917 (waist circumference models), 401 435 (BMI), and 395 640 (body fat percentage). Greater density of physical activity facilities within 1000 m of home was independently associated with smaller waist circumference and lower BMI and body fat percentage. Compared with people with no nearby facilities, those with at least six facilities close to home had 1{\textperiodcentered}22 cm smaller waist circumference (95{\%} CI -1{\textperiodcentered}64 to -0{\textperiodcentered}80), 0{\textperiodcentered}57 kg/m(2) lower BMI (-0{\textperiodcentered}74 to -0{\textperiodcentered}39), and 0{\textperiodcentered}81 percentage points lower body fat (-1{\textperiodcentered}03 to -0{\textperiodcentered}59). Living further from a fast-food outlet was weakly associated with waist circumference and BMI, mostly among women. Compared with people living fewer than 500 m from a fast-food outlet, those living at least 2000 m away had 0{\textperiodcentered}26 cm smaller waist circumference (-0{\textperiodcentered}52 to 0{\textperiodcentered}01). INTERPRETATION: This study shows strong associations between high densities of physical activity facilities and lower adiposity for adults in mid-life. We observed weaker associations for access to fast food, but these are likely to be underestimated owing to limitations of the food environment measure. Policy makers should consider interventions aimed at tackling the obesogenic built environment. FUNDING: Commonwealth Scholarship Commission, Wellcome Trust Institutional Strategic Support Fund.},

Using Mendelian randomisation (MR), we sought to evaluate associations between polyunsaturated (PUFA), monounsaturated (MUFA) and saturated FAs (SFAs) and CRC risk. METHODS: We analysed genotype data on 9254 CRC cases and 18,386 controls of European ancestry. Externally weighted polygenic risk scores were generated and used to evaluate associations with CRC per one standard deviation increase in genetically defined plasma FA levels. RESULTS: Risk reduction was observed for oleic and palmitoleic MUFAs (OR(OA) = 0.77, 95{\%} CI: 0.65-0.92, P = 3.9 × 10(-3); OR(POA) = 0.36, 95{\%} CI: 0.15-0.84, P = 0.018). PUFAs linoleic and arachidonic acid had negative and positive associations with CRC respectively (OR(LA) = 0.95, 95{\%} CI: 0.93-0.98, P = 3.7 × 10(-4); OR(AA) = 1.05, 95{\%} CI: 1.02-1.07, P = 1.7 × 10(-4)). The SFA stearic acid was associated with increased CRC risk (OR(SA) = 1.17, 95{\%} CI: 1.01-1.35, P = 0.041). CONCLUSION: Results from our analysis are broadly consistent with a pro-inflammatory FA profile having a detrimental effect in terms of CRC risk.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Synthesis of multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in a systematic review can summarize the effects of individual outcomes and provide numerical answers about the effectiveness of interventions. Filtering of searches is time consuming, and no single method fulfills the principal requirements of speed with accuracy. Automation of systematic reviews is driven by a necessity to expedite the availability of current best evidence for policy and clinical decision-making. We developed Rayyan ( http://rayyan.qcri.org ), a free web and mobile app, that helps expedite the initial screening of abstracts and titles using a process of semi-automation while incorporating a high level of usability. For the beta testing phase, we used two published Cochrane reviews in which included studies had been selected manually. Their searches, with 1030 records and 273 records, were uploaded to Rayyan. Different features of Rayyan were tested using these two reviews. We also conducted a survey of Rayyan's users and collected feedback through a built-in feature. RESULTS: Pilot testing of Rayyan focused on usability, accuracy against manual methods, and the added value of the prediction feature. The "taster" review (273 records) allowed a quick overview of Rayyan for early comments on usability. The second review (1030 records) required several iterations to identify the previously identified 11 trials. The "suggestions" and "hints," based on the "prediction model," appeared as testing progressed beyond five included studies. Post rollout user experiences and a reflexive response by the developers enabled real-time modifications and improvements. The survey respondents reported 40{\%} average time savings when using Rayyan compared to others tools, with 34{\%} of the respondents reporting more than 50{\%} time savings. In addition, around 75{\%} of the respondents mentioned that screening and labeling studies as well as collaborating on reviews to be the two most important features of Rayyan. As of November 2016, Rayyan users exceed 2000 from over 60 countries conducting hundreds of reviews totaling more than 1.6M citations. Feedback from users, obtained mostly through the app web site and a recent survey, has highlighted the ease in exploration of searches, the time saved, and simplicity in sharing and comparing include-exclude decisions. The strongest features of the app, identified and reported in user feedback, were its ability to help in screening and collaboration as well as the time savings it affords to users. CONCLUSIONS: Rayyan is responsive and intuitive in use with significant potential to lighten the load of reviewers.},

By integrative analyses of genome-wide association studies (GWASs), 14 adipose-specific/enhanced genes and 60 DEGs were found to be associated with obesity-related traits and diseases, consolidating evidence for contribution of these genes to the regional fat distribution and obesity phenotypes. In addition, expression of HOXC cluster was up-regulated in subcutaneous adipose tissue, and the majority of the HOXB cluster was expressed highly in omental adipose tissue, indicating differential expression patterns of HOX clusters in adipose depots. Our findings on the distinct gene expression profiles in adipose tissue and their relation to obesity provide an important foundation for future functional biological studies and therapeutic targets in obesity and associated diseases.},

The increasing proportion of young-onset and childhood type 2 diabetes is posing a particular threat, with these patients being at increased risk of developing diabetic complications. East Asian patients with type 2 diabetes have a higher risk of developing renal complications than Europeans and, with regard to cardiovascular complications, a predisposition for developing strokes. In addition to cardiovascular-renal disease, cancer is emerging as the other main cause of mortality. While more research is needed to explain these interethnic differences, urgent and concerted actions are needed to raise awareness, facilitate early diagnosis, and encourage preventive strategies to combat these growing disease burdens.},

We explored the prospective role of metabolic risk in eating disorders in a UK cohort (n = 2929 participants), measuring 158 metabolic traits in non-fasting EDTA-plasma by nuclear magnetic resonance. We associated metabolic markers at 7 years (exposure) with risk for anorexia nervosa and binge-eating disorder (outcomes) at 14, 16, and 18 years using logistic regression adjusted for maternal education, child's sex, age, body mass index, and calorie intake at 7 years. Elevated very low-density lipoproteins, triglycerides, apolipoprotein-B/A, and monounsaturated fatty acids ratio were associated with lower odds of anorexia nervosa at age 18, while elevated high-density lipoproteins, docosahexaenoic acid and polyunsaturated fatty acids ratio, and fatty acid unsaturation were associated with higher risk for anorexia nervosa at 18 years. Elevated linoleic acid and n-6 fatty acid ratios were associated with lower odds of binge-eating disorder at 16 years, while elevated saturated fatty acid ratio was associated with higher odds of binge-eating disorder. Most associations had large confidence intervals and showed, for anorexia nervosa, different directions across time points. Overall, our results show some evidence for a role of metabolic factors in eating disorders development in adolescence.},

abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Estimates of the relative mortality risks associated with normal weight, overweight, and obesity may help to inform decision making in the clinical setting. OBJECTIVE: To perform a systematic review of reported hazard ratios (HRs) of all-cause mortality for overweight and obesity relative to normal weight in the general population. DATA SOURCES: PubMed and EMBASE electronic databases were searched through September 30, 2012, without language restrictions. STUDY SELECTION: Articles that reported HRs for all-cause mortality using standard body mass index (BMI) categories from prospective studies of general populations of adults were selected by consensus among multiple reviewers. Studies were excluded that used nonstandard categories or that were limited to adolescents or to those with specific medical conditions or to those undergoing specific procedures. PubMed searches yielded 7034 articles, of which 141 (2.0{\%}) were eligible. An EMBASE search yielded 2 additional articles. After eliminating overlap, 97 studies were retained for analysis, providing a combined sample size of more than 2.88 million individuals and more than 270,000 deaths. DATA EXTRACTION: Data were extracted by 1 reviewer and then reviewed by 3 independent reviewers. We selected the most complex model available for the full sample and used a variety of sensitivity analyses to address issues of possible overadjustment (adjusted for factors in causal pathway) or underadjustment (not adjusted for at least age, sex, and smoking). RESULTS: Random-effects summary all-cause mortality HRs for overweight (BMI of 25-{\textless}30), obesity (BMI of ≥30), grade 1 obesity (BMI of 30-{\textless}35), and grades 2 and 3 obesity (BMI of ≥35) were calculated relative to normal weight (BMI of 18.5-{\textless}25). The summary HRs were 0.94 (95{\%} CI, 0.91-0.96) for overweight, 1.18 (95{\%} CI, 1.12-1.25) for obesity (all grades combined), 0.95 (95{\%} CI, 0.88-1.01) for grade 1 obesity, and 1.29 (95{\%} CI, 1.18-1.41) for grades 2 and 3 obesity. These findings persisted when limited to studies with measured weight and height that were considered to be adequately adjusted. The HRs tended to be higher when weight and height were self-reported rather than measured. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Relative to normal weight, both obesity (all grades) and grades 2 and 3 obesity were associated with significantly higher all-cause mortality. Grade 1 obesity overall was not associated with higher mortality, and overweight was associated with significantly lower all-cause mortality. The use of predefined standard BMI groupings can facilitate between-study comparisons.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE The obesity paradox in which overweight/obesity is associated with mortality benefits is believed to be explained by confounding and reverse causality rather than by a genuine clinical benefit of excess body weight. We aimed to gain deeper insights into the paradox through analyzing mortality relationships with several adiposity measures; assessing subgroups with type 2 diabetes, with coronary heart disease (CHD), with cancer, and by smoking status; and adjusting for several confounders.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We studied the general UK Biobank population (N = 502,631) along with three subgroups of people with type 2 diabetes (n = 23,842), CHD (n = 24,268), and cancer (n = 45,790) at baseline. A range of adiposity exposures were considered, including BMI (continuous and categorical), waist circumference, body fat percentage, and waist-to-hip ratio, and the outcome was all-cause mortality. We used Cox regression models adjusted for age, smoking status, deprivation index, education, and disease history.RESULTS For BMI, the obesity paradox was observed among people with type 2 diabetes (adjusted hazard ratio for obese vs. normal BMI 0.78 [95{\%} CI 0.65, 0.95]) but not among those with CHD (1.00 [0.86, 1.17]). The obesity paradox was pronounced in current smokers, absent in never smokers, and more pronounced in men than in women. For other adiposity measures, there was less evidence for an obesity paradox, yet smoking status consistently modified the adiposity-mortality relationship.CONCLUSIONS The obesity paradox was observed in people with type 2 diabetes and is heavily modified by smoking status. The results of subgroup analyses and statistical adjustments are consistent with reverse causality and confounding.},

abstract = {Abstract Objective: To investigate whether the association between BMI and all-cause mortality could be disentangled into opposite effects of body fat and fat-free mass (FFM). Research Methods and Procedures: All-cause mortality was studied in the Danish follow-up study ?Diet, Cancer and Health? with 27, 178 men and 29, 875 women 50 to 64 years old recruited from 1993 to 1997. By the end of year 2001, the median follow-up was 5.8 years, and 1851 had died. Body composition was assessed by bioelectrical impedance. Cox regression models were used to estimate the relationships among body fat mass index (body fat mass divided by height squared), FFM index (FFM divided by height squared), and mortality. All analyses were adjusted for smoking habits. Results: Men and women showed similar associations. J-shaped associations were found between body fat mass index and mortality adjusted for FFM and smoking. The mortality rate ratios in the upper part of body fat mass were 1.12 per kg/m2 (95{\%} confidence interval: 1.07, 1.18) in men and 1.06 per kg/m2 (95{\%} confidence interval: 1.02, 1.10) in women. Reversed J-shaped associations were found between FFM index and mortality with a tendency to level off for high values of FFM. Discussion: Our findings suggest that BMI represents joint but opposite associations of body fat and FFM with mortality. Both high body fat and low FFM are independent predictors of all-cause mortality.},

abstract = {Adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) has been discovered 14 years ago and revised our view on intracellular triglyceride (TG) mobilization – a process termed lipolysis. ATGL initiates the hydrolysis of TGs to release fatty acids (FAs) that are crucial energy substrates, precursors for the synthesis of membrane lipids, and ligands of nuclear receptors. Thus, ATGL is a key enzyme in whole-body energy homeostasis. In this review, we give an update on how ATGL is regulated on the transcriptional and post-transcriptional level and how this affects the enzymes' activity in the context of neutral lipid catabolism. In depth, we highlight and discuss the numerous physiological functions of ATGL in lipid and energy metabolism. Over more than a decade, different genetic mouse models lacking or overexpressing ATGL in a cell- or tissue-specific manner have been generated and characterized. Moreover, pharmacological studies became available due to the development of a specific murine ATGL inhibitor (Atglistatin{\textregistered}). The identification of patients with mutations in the human gene encoding ATGL and their disease spectrum has underpinned the importance of ATGL in humans. Together, mouse models and human data have advanced our understanding of the physiological role of ATGL in lipid and energy metabolism in adipose and non-adipose tissues, and of the pathophysiological consequences of ATGL dysfunction in mice and men.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mendelian randomization uses genetic variants, assumed to be instrumental variables for a particular exposure, to estimate the causal effect of that exposure on an outcome. If the instrumental variable criteria are satisfied, the resulting estimator is consistent even in the presence of unmeasured confounding and reverse causation. METHODS: We extend the Mendelian randomization paradigm to investigate more complex networks of relationships between variables, in particular where some of the effect of an exposure on the outcome may operate through an intermediate variable (a mediator). If instrumental variables for the exposure and mediator are available, direct and indirect effects of the exposure on the outcome can be estimated, for example using either a regression-based method or structural equation models. The direction of effect between the exposure and a possible mediator can also be assessed. Methods are illustrated in an applied example considering causal relationships between body mass index, C-reactive protein and uric acid. RESULTS: These estimators are consistent in the presence of unmeasured confounding if, in addition to the instrumental variable assumptions, the effects of both the exposure on the mediator and the mediator on the outcome are homogeneous across individuals and linear without interactions. Nevertheless, a simulation study demonstrates that even considerable heterogeneity in these effects does not lead to bias in the estimates. CONCLUSIONS: These methods can be used to estimate direct and indirect causal effects in a mediation setting, and have potential for the investigation of more complex networks between multiple interrelated exposures and disease outcomes.},

Prevalence of ABG in normal-weight group with high {\%}BF (13.5{\%}) is significantly higher than the overweight group with low {\%}BF (10.5{\%}, P{\&}lt;0.001). In an unadjusted model, the OR of ABG was significantly greater in adults at normal BMI with high {\%}BF compared with individuals at normal weight with low {\%}BF. In an adjusted model controlling for age, sex, race/ethnicity, first-degree-relative diabetes, vigorous-intensity activities and muscle strengthening activities, risks of ABG were greater in population with normal weight and high {\%}BF (OR 1.55, 95{\%} CI 1.01 to 2.38) and with overweight and low {\%}BF (OR 1.17, 95{\%} CI 0.69 to 1.98, P{\&}lt;0.05).Conclusions Integrating BMI with {\%}BF can improve in classification to direct screening and prevention efforts to a group currently considered healthy and avoid penalties and stigmatisation of other groups that are classified as high risk of ABG.},

We investigated associations between different adiposity measures, BMI from childhood through adulthood, and metabolites quantified from serum using (1)H NMR spectroscopy in 900 British men and women aged 60-64. We assessed BMI, waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), android-to-gynoid fat ratio (AGR), and BMI from childhood through adulthood. Linear regression with Bonferroni adjustment was performed to assess adiposity and metabolites. Of 233 metabolites, 168; 126; and 133 were associated with BMI, WHR, and AGR at age 60-64, respectively. Associations were strongest for HDL, particularly HDL particle size-e.g., there was 0.08 SD decrease in HDL diameter (95{\%} CI: 0.07-0.10) with each unit increase in BMI. BMI-adjusted AGR or WHR were associated with 31 metabolites where there was no metabolome-wide association with BMI. We identified inverse associations between BMI at age 7 and glucose or glycoprotein at age 60-64 and relatively large LDL cholesteryl ester with postadolescent BMI gains. In summary, we identified metabolomic correlates of central adiposity and earlier-life BMI. These findings support opportunities to leverage metabolomics in early prevention of cardiovascular risk attributable to body fatness.},

abstract = {Summary Background Underweight and severe and morbid obesity are associated with highly elevated risks of adverse health outcomes. We estimated trends in mean body-mass index (BMI), which characterises its population distribution, and in the prevalences of a complete set of BMI categories for adults in all countries. Methods We analysed, with use of a consistent protocol, population-based studies that had measured height and weight in adults aged 18 years and older. We applied a Bayesian hierarchical model to these data to estimate trends from 1975 to 2014 in mean BMI and in the prevalences of BMI categories ({\textless}18{\textperiodcentered}5 kg/m2 [underweight], 18{\textperiodcentered}5 kg/m2 to {\textless}20 kg/m2, 20 kg/m2 to {\textless}25 kg/m2, 25 kg/m2 to {\textless}30 kg/m2, 30 kg/m2 to {\textless}35 kg/m2, 35 kg/m2 to {\textless}40 kg/m2, ≥40 kg/m2 [morbid obesity]), by sex in 200 countries and territories, organised in 21 regions. We calculated the posterior probability of meeting the target of halting by 2025 the rise in obesity at its 2010 levels, if post-2000 trends continue. Findings We used 1698 population-based data sources, with more than 19{\textperiodcentered}2 million adult participants (9{\textperiodcentered}9 million men and 9{\textperiodcentered}3 million women) in 186 of 200 countries for which estimates were made. Global age-standardised mean BMI increased from 21{\textperiodcentered}7 kg/m2 (95{\%} credible interval 21{\textperiodcentered}3–22{\textperiodcentered}1) in 1975 to 24{\textperiodcentered}2 kg/m2 (24{\textperiodcentered}0–24{\textperiodcentered}4) in 2014 in men, and from 22{\textperiodcentered}1 kg/m2 (21{\textperiodcentered}7–22{\textperiodcentered}5) in 1975 to 24{\textperiodcentered}4 kg/m2 (24{\textperiodcentered}2–24{\textperiodcentered}6) in 2014 in women. Regional mean BMIs in 2014 for men ranged from 21{\textperiodcentered}4 kg/m2 in central Africa and south Asia to 29{\textperiodcentered}2 kg/m2 (28{\textperiodcentered}6–29{\textperiodcentered}8) in Polynesia and Micronesia; for women the range was from 21{\textperiodcentered}8 kg/m2 (21{\textperiodcentered}4–22{\textperiodcentered}3) in south Asia to 32{\textperiodcentered}2 kg/m2 (31{\textperiodcentered}5–32{\textperiodcentered}8) in Polynesia and Micronesia. Over these four decades, age-standardised global prevalence of underweight decreased from 13{\textperiodcentered}8{\%} (10{\textperiodcentered}5–17{\textperiodcentered}4) to 8{\textperiodcentered}8{\%} (7{\textperiodcentered}4–10{\textperiodcentered}3) in men and from 14{\textperiodcentered}6{\%} (11{\textperiodcentered}6–17{\textperiodcentered}9) to 9{\textperiodcentered}7{\%} (8{\textperiodcentered}3–11{\textperiodcentered}1) in women. South Asia had the highest prevalence of underweight in 2014, 23{\textperiodcentered}4{\%} (17{\textperiodcentered}8–29{\textperiodcentered}2) in men and 24{\textperiodcentered}0{\%} (18{\textperiodcentered}9–29{\textperiodcentered}3) in women. Age-standardised prevalence of obesity increased from 3{\textperiodcentered}2{\%} (2{\textperiodcentered}4–4{\textperiodcentered}1) in 1975 to 10{\textperiodcentered}8{\%} (9{\textperiodcentered}7–12{\textperiodcentered}0) in 2014 in men, and from 6{\textperiodcentered}4{\%} (5{\textperiodcentered}1–7{\textperiodcentered}8) to 14{\textperiodcentered}9{\%} (13{\textperiodcentered}6–16{\textperiodcentered}1) in women. 2{\textperiodcentered}3{\%} (2{\textperiodcentered}0–2{\textperiodcentered}7) of the world's men and 5{\textperiodcentered}0{\%} (4{\textperiodcentered}4–5{\textperiodcentered}6) of women were severely obese (ie, have BMI ≥35 kg/m2). Globally, prevalence of morbid obesity was 0{\textperiodcentered}64{\%} (0{\textperiodcentered}46–0{\textperiodcentered}86) in men and 1{\textperiodcentered}6{\%} (1{\textperiodcentered}3–1{\textperiodcentered}9) in women. Interpretation If post-2000 trends continue, the probability of meeting the global obesity target is virtually zero. Rather, if these trends continue, by 2025, global obesity prevalence will reach 18{\%} in men and surpass 21{\%} in women; severe obesity will surpass 6{\%} in men and 9{\%} in women.

abstract = {Obesity and diabetes mellitus are great public health concerns throughout the world because of their increasing incidence and prevalence. Leptin, the adipocyte hormone, is well known for its role in the regulation of food intake and energy expenditure. In addition to the regulation of appetite and satiety that recently has attracted much attentions, insight has also been gained into the critical role of leptin in the control of the insulin-glucose axis, peripheral glucose and insulin responsiveness. Since the discovery of leptin, leptin has been taken for its therapeutic potential to obesity and diabetes. Recently, the therapeutic effects of central leptin gene therapy have been reported in insulin-deficient diabetes in obesity animal models such as ob/ob mise, diet-induced obese mice, and insulin-deficient type 1 diabetes mice, and also in patients with inactivating mutations in the leptin gene. Herein, we review the role of leptin in regulating feeding behavior and glucose metabolism and also the therapeutic potential of leptin in obesity and diabetes mellitus.},

abstract = {Obesity is heritable and predisposes to many diseases. To understand the genetic basis of obesity better, here we conduct a genome-wide association study and Metabochip meta-analysis of body mass index (BMI), a measure commonly used to define obesity and assess adiposity, in up to 339,224 individuals. This analysis identifies 97 BMI-associated loci (P {\textless} 5 [times] 10-8), 56 of which are novel. Five loci demonstrate clear evidence of several independent association signals, and many loci have significant effects on other metabolic phenotypes. The 97 loci account for [sim]2.7{\%} of BMI variation, and genome-wide estimates suggest that common variation accounts for {\textgreater}20{\%} of BMI variation. Pathway analyses provide strong support for a role of the central nervous system in obesity susceptibility and implicate new genes and pathways, including those related to synaptic function, glutamate signalling, insulin secretion/action, energy metabolism, lipid biology and adipogenesis.},

Physiol Rev 84: 277?359, 2004; 10.1152/physrev.00015.2003.?The function of brown adipose tissue is to transfer energy from food into heat; physiologically, both the heat produced and the resulting decrease in metabolic efficiency can be of significance. Both the acute activity of the tissue, i.e., the heat production, and the recruitment process in the tissue (that results in a higher thermogenic capacity) are under the control of norepinephrine released from sympathetic nerves. In thermoregulatory thermogenesis, brown adipose tissue is essential for classical nonshivering thermogen-esis (this phenomenon does not exist in the absence of functional brown adipose tissue), as well as for the cold acclimation-recruited norepinephrine-induced thermogenesis. Heat production from brown adipose tissue is activated whenever the organism is in need of extra heat, e.g., postnatally, during entry into a febrile state, and during arousal from hibernation, and the rate of thermogenesis is centrally controlled via a pathway initiated in the hypothalamus. Feeding as such also results in activation of brown adipose tissue; a series of diets, apparently all characterized by being low in protein, result in a leptin-dependent recruitment of the tissue; this metaboloregulatory thermogenesis is also under hypothalamic control. When the tissue is active, high amounts of lipids and glucose are combusted in the tissue. The development of brown adipose tissue with its characteristic protein, uncoupling protein-1 (UCP1), was probably determinative for the evolutionary success of mammals, as its thermogenesis enhances neonatal survival and allows for active life even in cold surroundings.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To review progress in understanding the methods and results concerning the causal contribution of body mass index (BMI) to health and disease. METHODS: In the context of conventional evidence focused on the relationship between BMI and health, this review considers current literature on the common, population-based, genetic contribution to BMI and how this has fed into the developing field of applied epidemiology. RESULTS: Technological and analytical developments have driven considerable success in identifying genetic variants relevant to BMI. This has enabled the implementation of Mendelian randomization to address questions of causality. The product of this work has been the implication of BMI as a causal agent in a host of health outcomes. Further breakdown of causal pathways by integration with other "omics" technologies promises to deliver additional benefit. CONCLUSIONS: Gaps remain in our understanding of BMI as a risk factor for health and disease, and while promising, applied genetic epidemiology should be considered alongside alternative methods for assessing the impact of BMI on health. Potential limitations, relating to inappropriate or nonspecific measures of obesity and the improper use of genetic instruments, will need to be explored and incorporated into future research aiming to dissect BMI as a risk factor.},

However, identifying and prioritizing mechanisms for further analytical evaluation presents enormous challenges in terms of the quantity and diversity of published research. The application of data mining approaches to the literature offers the potential to identify and prioritize mechanisms for more focused and detailed analysis.Here we present MELODI, a literature mining platform that can identify mechanistic pathways between any two biomedical concepts.Two case studies demonstrate the potential uses of MELODI and how it can generate hypotheses for further investigation. First, an analysis of ETS-related gene ERG and prostate cancer derives the intermediate transcription factor SP1, recently confirmed to be physically interacting with ERG. Second, examining the relationship between a new potential risk factor for pancreatic cancer identifies possible mechanistic insights which can be studied in vitro.We have demonstrated the possible applications of MELODI, including two case studies. MELODI has been implemented as a Python/Django web application, and is freely available to use at [www.melodi.biocompute.org.uk].},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The relationship between central obesity and survival in community-dwelling adults with normal body mass index (BMI) is not well-known. OBJECTIVE: To examine total and cardiovascular mortality risks associated with central obesity and normal BMI. DESIGN: Stratified multistage probability design. SETTING: NHANES III (Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey). PARTICIPANTS: 15,184 adults (52.3{\%} women) aged 18 to 90 years. MEASUREMENTS: Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate the relationship of obesity patterns defined by BMI and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) and total and cardiovascular mortality risk after adjustment for confounding factors. RESULTS: Persons with normal-weight central obesity had the worst long-term survival. For example, a man with a normal BMI (22 kg/m2) and central obesity had greater total mortality risk than one with similar BMI but no central obesity (hazard ratio [HR], 1.87 [95{\%} CI, 1.53 to 2.29]), and this man had twice the mortality risk of participants who were overweight or obese according to BMI only (HR, 2.24 [CI, 1.52 to 3.32] and 2.42 [CI, 1.30 to 4.53], respectively). Women with normal-weight central obesity also had a higher mortality risk than those with similar BMI but no central obesity (HR, 1.48 [CI, 1.35 to 1.62]) and those who were obese according to BMI only (HR, 1.32 [CI, 1.15 to 1.51]). Expected survival estimates were consistently lower for those with central obesity when age and BMI were controlled for. LIMITATIONS: Body fat distribution was assessed based on anthropometric indicators alone. Information on comorbidities was collected by self-report. CONCLUSION: Normal-weight central obesity defined by WHR is associated with higher mortality than BMI-defined obesity, particularly in the absence of central fat distribution.

abstract = {Summary Excess bodyweight is the sixth most important risk factor contributing to the overall burden of disease worldwide. 1{\textperiodcentered}1 billion adults and 10{\%} of children are now classified as overweight or obese. Average life expectancy is already diminished; the main adverse consequences are cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and several cancers. The complex pathological processes reflect environmental and genetic interactions, and individuals from disadvantaged communities seem to have greater risks than more affluent individuals partly because of fetal and postnatal imprinting. Obesity, with its array of comorbidities, necessitates careful clinical assessment to identify underlying factors and to allow coherent management. The epidemic reflects progressive secular and age-related decreases in physical activity, together with substantial dietary changes with passive over-consumption of energy despite the neurobiological processes controlling food intake. Effective long-term weight loss depends on permanent changes in dietary quality, energy intake, and activity. Neither the medical management nor the societal preventive challenges are currently being met.},

All pregnant women resident in a defined area in the South West of England, with an expected date of delivery between 1st April 1991 and 31st December 1992, were eligible and 13761 women (contributing 13867 pregnancies) were recruited. These women have been followed over the last 19-22 years and have completed up to 20 questionnaires, have had detailed data abstracted from their medical records and have information on any cancer diagnoses and deaths through record linkage. A follow-up assessment was completed 17-18 years postnatal at which anthropometry, blood pressure, fat, lean and bone mass and carotid intima media thickness were assessed, and a fasting blood sample taken. The second follow-up clinic, which additionally measures cognitive function, physical capability, physical activity (with accelerometer) and wrist bone architecture, is underway and two further assessments with similar measurements will take place over the next 5 years. There is a detailed biobank that includes DNA, with genome-wide data available on {\textgreater}10000, stored serum and plasma taken repeatedly since pregnancy and other samples; a wide range of data on completed biospecimen assays are available.

In this study conducted in samples of 81 men and 70 women, data are presented on the anthropornetric correlates of abdominal visceral adipose tissue accumulation and related cardiovascular disease risk factors (trigiyceride and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, fasting and postglucose insulin and glucose levels). Results indicate that the waist circumference and the abdominal sagittal diameter are better correlates of abdominal visceral adipose tissue accumulation than the commonly used waist-to-hip ratio (WHR). In women, the waist circumference and the abdominal sagittal diameter also appeared more closely related to the metabolic variables than the WHR. When the samples were divided into quintiles of waist circumference, WHR or abdominal sagittal diameter, it was noted that increasing values of waist circumference and abdominal sagittal diameter were more consistently associated with increases in fasting and postglucose insulin levels than increasing values of WHR, especially in women. These findings suggest that the waist circumference or the abdominal sagittal diameter, rather than the WHR, should be used as indexes of abdominal visceral adipose tissue deposition and in the assessment of cardiovascular risk. It is suggested from these data that waist circumference values above approximately 100 cm, or abdominal sagittal diameter values {\textgreater}25 cm are most likely to be associated with potentially “atherogenic” metabolic disturbances.},

abstract = {The relationship between obesity and cognitive impairment is important given the globally ageing population in whom cognitive decline and neurodegenerative disorders will carry grave individual, societal and financial burdens. This review examines the evidence for the link between obesity and cognitive function in terms of both the immediate effects on cognitive performance, and effects on the trajectory of cognitive ageing and likelihood of dementia. In mid-life, there is a strong association between obesity and impaired cognitive function. Anthropometric measures of obesity are also associated with reduced neural integrity (e.g. grey and white matter atrophy). Increasing age coupled with the negative metabolic consequences of obesity (e.g. type 2 diabetes mellitus) are likely to significantly contribute to cognitive decline and incidence of dementia. Stress is identified as a potential risk factor promoting abdominal obesity and contributing to impaired cognitive function. However, the potentially protective effects of obesity against cognitive decline in older age require further examination. Finally, surgical and whole diet interventions, which address obesity may improve cognitive capacity and confer some protection against later cognitive decline. In conclusion, obesity and its comorbidities are associated with impaired cognitive performance, accelerated cognitive decline and neurodegenerative pathologies such as dementia in later life. Interventions targeting mid-life obesity may prove beneficial in reducing the cognitive risks associated with obesity.},

@article{Bray2004,
abstract = {Obesity is an epidemic disease that threatens to inundate health care resources by increasing the incidence of diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, and cancer. These effects of obesity result from two factors: the increased mass of adipose tissue and the increased secretion of pathogenetic products from enlarged fat cells. This concept of the pathogenesis of obesity as a disease allows an easy division of disadvantages of obesity into those produced by the mass of fat and those produced by the metabolic effects of fat cells. In the former category are the social disabilities resulting from the stigma associated with obesity, sleep apnea that results in part from increased parapharyngeal fat deposits, and osteoarthritis resulting from the wear and tear on joints from carrying an increased mass of fat. The second category includes the metabolic factors associated with distant effects of products released from enlarged fat cells. The insulin-resistant state that is so common in obesity probably reflects the effects of increased release of fatty acids from fat cells that are then stored in the liver or muscle. When the secretory capacity of the pancreas is overwhelmed by battling insulin resistance, diabetes develops. The strong association of increased fat, especially visceral fat, with diabetes makes this consequence particularly ominous for health care costs. The release of cytokines, particularly IL-6, from the fat cell may stimulate the proinflammatory state that characterizes obesity. The increased secretion of prothrombin activator inhibitor-1 from fat cells may play a role in the procoagulant state of obesity and, along with changes in endothelial function, may be responsible for the increased risk of cardiovascular disease and hypertension. For cancer, the production of estrogens by the enlarged stromal mass plays a role in the risk for breast cancer. Increased cytokine release may play a role in other forms of proliferative growth. The combined effect of these pathogenetic consequences of increased fat stores is an increased risk of shortened life expectancy.},

Given this investment, it is the ideal time to start planning strategies to capitalize on the infrastructure being established. An obvious gap in the literature relates to the effective use of metabolomics in large-population studies. Although published reports from population-based studies are beginning to emerge, the number to date remains relatively small. Yet, there is great potential for using metabolomics in population-based studies to evaluate the effects of nutritional, pharmaceutical, and environmental exposures (the "exposome"); conduct risk assessments; predict disease development; and diagnose diseases. Currently, the majority of the metabolomics studies in human populations are in nutrition or nutrition-related fields. This symposium provided a timely venue to highlight the current state-of-science on the use of metabolomics in population-based research. This session provided a forum at which investigators with extensive experience in performing research within large initiatives, multi-investigator grants, and epidemiology consortia could stimulate discussion and ideas for population-based metabolomics research and, in turn, improve knowledge to help devise effective methods of health research.},

However, 2SMR methods are evolving rapidly and GWAS results are often insufficiently curated, undermining efficient implementation of the approach. We therefore developed MR-Base (http://www.mrbase.org): a platform that integrates a curated database of complete GWAS results (no restrictions according to statistical significance) with an application programming interface, web app and R packages that automate 2SMR. The software includes several sensitivity analyses for assessing the impact of horizontal pleiotropy and other violations of assumptions. The database currently comprises 11 billion single nucleotide polymorphism-trait associations from 1673 GWAS and is updated on a regular basis. Integrating data with software ensures more rigorous application of hypothesis-driven analyses and allows millions of potential causal relationships to be efficiently evaluated in phenome-wide association studies.},

Besides adipocytes, adipose tissue contains connective tissue matrix, nerve tissue, stromovascular cells, and immune cells. Together these components function as an integrated unit. Adipose tissue not only responds to afferent signals from traditional hormone systems and the central nervous system but also expresses and secretes factors with important endocrine functions. These factors include leptin, other cytokines, adiponectin, complement components, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, proteins of the renin-angiotensin system, and resistin. Adipose tissue is also a major site for metabolism of sex steroids and glucocorticoids. The important endocrine function of adipose tissue is emphasized by the adverse metabolic consequences of both adipose tissue excess and deficiency. A better understanding of the endocrine function of adipose tissue will likely lead to more rational therapy for these increasingly prevalent disorders.

abstract = {Background: Body mass index (BMI) is the most widely used measure to diagnose obesity. However, the accuracy of BMI in detecting excess body adiposity in the adult general population is largely unknown. Methods: A cross-sectional design of 13 601 subjects (age 20-79.9 years; 49{\%} men) from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Bioelectrical impedance analysis was used to estimate body fat percent (BF{\%}). We assessed the diagnostic performance of BMI using the World Health Organization reference standard for obesity of BF{\%}{\textgreater}25{\%} in men and {\textgreater}35{\%} in women. We tested the correlation between BMI and both BF{\%} and lean mass by sex and age groups adjusted for race. Results: BMI-defined obesity (≥30 kg m -2 ) was present in 19.1{\%} of men and 24.7{\%} of women, while BF{\%}-defined obesity was present in 43.9{\%} of men and 52.3{\%} of women. A BMI≥30 had a high specificity (men=95{\%}, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI), 94-96 and women=99{\%}, 95{\%} CI, 98-100), but a poor sensitivity (men=36{\%}, 95{\%} CI, 35-37 and women=49{\%}, 95{\%} CI, 48-50) to detect BF{\%}-defined obesity. The diagnostic performance of BMI diminished as age increased. In men, BMI had a better correlation with lean mass than with BF{\%}, while in women BMI correlated better with BF{\%} than with lean mass. However, in the intermediate range of BMI (25-29.9 kg m -2 ), BMI failed to discriminate between BF{\%} and lean mass in both sexes. Conclusions: The accuracy of BMI in diagnosing obesity is limited, particularly for individuals in the intermediate BMI ranges, in men and in the elderly. A BMI cutoff of≥30 kg m -2 has good specificity but misses more than half of people with excess fat. These results may help to explain the unexpected better survival in overweight/mild obese patients. {\textcopyright} 2008 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: High body-mass index (BMI) predisposes to several site-specific cancers, but a large-scale systematic and detailed characterisation of patterns of risk across all common cancers adjusted for potential confounders has not previously been undertaken. We aimed to investigate the links between BMI and the most common site-specific cancers. METHODS: With primary care data from individuals in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink with BMI data, we fitted Cox models to investigate associations between BMI and 22 of the most common cancers, adjusting for potential confounders. We fitted linear then non-linear (spline) models; investigated effect modification by sex, menopausal status, smoking, and age; and calculated population effects. FINDINGS: 5{\textperiodcentered}24 million individuals were included; 166,955 developed cancers of interest. BMI was associated with 17 of 22 cancers, but effects varied substantially by site. Each 5 kg/m(2) increase in BMI was roughly linearly associated with cancers of the uterus (hazard ratio [HR] 1{\textperiodcentered}62, 99{\%} CI 1{\textperiodcentered}56-1{\textperiodcentered}69; p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001), gallbladder (1{\textperiodcentered}31, 1{\textperiodcentered}12-1{\textperiodcentered}52; p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001), kidney (1{\textperiodcentered}25, 1{\textperiodcentered}17-1{\textperiodcentered}33; p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001), cervix (1{\textperiodcentered}10, 1{\textperiodcentered}03-1{\textperiodcentered}17; p=0{\textperiodcentered}00035), thyroid (1{\textperiodcentered}09, 1{\textperiodcentered}00-1{\textperiodcentered}19; p=0{\textperiodcentered}0088), and leukaemia (1{\textperiodcentered}09, 1{\textperiodcentered}05-1{\textperiodcentered}13; p≤0{\textperiodcentered}0001). BMI was positively associated with liver (1{\textperiodcentered}19, 1{\textperiodcentered}12-1{\textperiodcentered}27), colon (1{\textperiodcentered}10, 1{\textperiodcentered}07-1{\textperiodcentered}13), ovarian (1{\textperiodcentered}09, 1.04-1.14), and postmenopausal breast cancers (1{\textperiodcentered}05, 1{\textperiodcentered}03-1{\textperiodcentered}07) overall (all p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001), but these effects varied by underlying BMI or individual-level characteristics. We estimated inverse associations with prostate and premenopausal breast cancer risk, both overall (prostate 0{\textperiodcentered}98, 0{\textperiodcentered}95-1{\textperiodcentered}00; premenopausal breast cancer 0{\textperiodcentered}89, 0{\textperiodcentered}86-0{\textperiodcentered}92) and in never-smokers (prostate 0{\textperiodcentered}96, 0{\textperiodcentered}93-0{\textperiodcentered}99; premenopausal breast cancer 0{\textperiodcentered}89, 0{\textperiodcentered}85-0{\textperiodcentered}94). By contrast, for lung and oral cavity cancer, we observed no association in never smokers (lung 0{\textperiodcentered}99, 0{\textperiodcentered}93-1{\textperiodcentered}05; oral cavity 1{\textperiodcentered}07, 0{\textperiodcentered}91-1{\textperiodcentered}26): inverse associations overall were driven by current smokers and ex-smokers, probably because of residual confounding by smoking amount. Assuming causality, 41{\%} of uterine and 10{\%} or more of gallbladder, kidney, liver, and colon cancers could be attributable to excess weight. We estimated that a 1 kg/m(2) population-wide increase in BMI would result in 3790 additional annual UK patients developing one of the ten cancers positively associated with BMI. INTERPRETATION: BMI is associated with cancer risk, with substantial population-level effects. The heterogeneity in the effects suggests that different mechanisms are associated with different cancer sites and different patient subgroups.

Despite lack of a typical secretory signal peptide, FABP4 has been shown to be released from adipocytes in a non-classical pathway associated with lipolysis, possibly acting as an adipokine. Elevation of circulating FABP4 levels is associated with obesity, insulin resistance, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cardiac dysfunction, atherosclerosis, and cardiovascular events. Furthermore, ectopic expression and function of FABP4 in several types of cells and tissues have been recently demonstrated.

Among the 11 cross-sectional studies that have formally tested the differences, most found a higher odds ratio or slightly larger area under the ROC curve (AUC) for WC than for BMI. A meta-analysis based on the individual data of the Asian cohorts using a paired homogeneity test showed, however, that there was no difference in odds ratio between BMI and WC in Chinese, Japanese, Indian, Mongolian and Filipino men. In conclusion, all studies included in this review showed that either BMI or WC (WHR) predicted or was associated with type II diabetes independently, regardless of the controversial findings on which of these obesity indicators is better.},

Using a novel approach of regressing (272,081) parental lifespans beyond age 40 years on participant genotype in a new large data set (UK Biobank), we here show that common variants near the apolipoprotein E and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit alpha 5 genes are associated with lifespan. The effects are strongly sex and age dependent, with APOE ɛ4 differentially influencing maternal lifespan (P=4.2 × 10(-15), effect -1.24 years of maternal life per imputed risk allele in parent; sex difference, P=0.011), and a locus near CHRNA3/5 differentially affecting paternal lifespan (P=4.8 × 10(-11), effect -0.86 years per allele; sex difference P=0.075). Rare homozygous carriers of the risk alleles at both loci are predicted to have 3.3-3.7 years shorter lives.},

The rapid growth in metabolomics is leading to a renewed interest in metabolism and the role that small molecule metabolites play in many biological processes. As a result, traditional views of metabolites as being simply the ?bricks and mortar? of cells or just the fuel for cellular energetics are being upended. Indeed, metabolites appear to have much more varied and far more important roles as signaling molecules, immune modulators, endogenous toxins, and environmental sensors. This review explores how metabolomics is yielding important new insights into a number of important biological and physiological processes. In particular, a major focus is on illustrating how metabolomics and discoveries made through metabolomics are improving our understanding of both normal physiology and the pathophysiology of many diseases. These discoveries are yielding new insights into how metabolites influence organ function, immune function, nutrient sensing, and gut physiology. Collectively, this work is leading to a much more unified and system-wide perspective of biology wherein metabolites, proteins, and genes are understood to interact synergistically to modify the actions and functions of organelles, organs, and organisms.},

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma and CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins have emerged as master regulators of adipogenesis, and recent genome-wide studies have indicated widespread overlap in their transcriptional targets. In addition, new evidence has implicated many other factors as positive and negative regulators of adipocyte development. This review highlights recent advances in the field of adipogenesis, including newly identified determinants of brown adipocytes, the function of which is to burn rather than store energy.

Therefore, we have conducted a meta-analysis of prospective studies, which examined the association of pre- and post-diagnostic BMI with colorectal cancer-specific mortality and all-cause mortality in patients with colorectal cancer. We searched Medline and EMBASE database published between 1970 and September 2014. A total of 508 articles were identified, of which 16 prospective cohort studies were included for the current meta-analysis. The analysis included 58,917 patients who were followed up over a period ranging from 4.9 to 20 years (median: 9.9 years). We found that being underweight before cancer diagnosis was associated with increased all-cause mortality (Relative risk [RR]: 1.63, 95{\%} CI: 1.18-2.23, p {\textless} 0.01) and being obese (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m(2)) before cancer diagnosis was associated with increased colorectal cancer-specific mortality (RR: 1.22, 95{\%} CI: 1.003-1.35, p {\textless} 0.01) and all-cause mortality (RR: 1.25, 95{\%} CI: 1.14-1.36, p {\textless} 0.01). On the other hand, being underweight (RR: 1.33, 95{\%} CI: 1.20-1.47, p {\textless} 0.01), obese (RR: 1.08, 95{\%} CI: 1.03-1.3, p {\textless} 0.01), and class II/III obese (BMI ≥ 35 kg/m(2); RR: 1.13, 95{\%} CI: 1.04-1.23, p {\textless} 0.01) after diagnosis were associated with significantly increased all-cause mortality. Being obese prior to diagnosis of colorectal cancer was associated with increased colorectal cancer-specific mortality and all-cause mortality, whereas being obese after diagnosis was associated with increased all-cause mortality. The associations with being underweight may reflect reverse causation. Maintaining a healthy body weight should be discussed with colorectal cancer survivors.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To use genetic variants as unconfounded proxies of C reactive protein concentration to study its causal role in coronary heart disease. DESIGN: Mendelian randomisation meta-analysis of individual participant data from 47 epidemiological studies in 15 countries. PARTICIPANTS: 194 418 participants, including 46 557 patients with prevalent or incident coronary heart disease. Information was available on four CRP gene tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs3093077, rs1205, rs1130864, rs1800947), concentration of C reactive protein, and levels of other risk factors. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Risk ratios for coronary heart disease associated with genetically raised C reactive protein versus risk ratios with equivalent differences in C reactive protein concentration itself, adjusted for conventional risk factors and variability in risk factor levels within individuals. RESULTS: CRP variants were each associated with up to 30{\%} per allele difference in concentration of C reactive protein (P{\textless}10(-34)) and were unrelated to other risk factors. Risk ratios for coronary heart disease per additional copy of an allele associated with raised C reactive protein were 0.93 (95{\%} confidence interval 0.87 to 1.00) for rs3093077; 1.00 (0.98 to 1.02) for rs1205; 0.98 (0.96 to 1.00) for rs1130864; and 0.99 (0.94 to 1.03) for rs1800947. In a combined analysis, the risk ratio for coronary heart disease was 1.00 (0.90 to 1.13) per 1 SD higher genetically raised natural log (ln) concentration of C reactive protein. The genetic findings were discordant with the risk ratio observed for coronary heart disease of 1.33 (1.23 to 1.43) per 1 SD higher circulating ln concentration of C reactive protein in prospective studies (P=0.001 for difference). CONCLUSION: Human genetic data indicate that C reactive protein concentration itself is unlikely to be even a modest causal factor in coronary heart disease.},

STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING {\&} PARTICIPANTS: Individual patient data pooled from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study and the Cardiovascular Health Study. PREDICTORS: Waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), body mass index (BMI). OUTCOMES {\&} MEASUREMENTS: Incident CKD defined as serum creatinine level increase greater than 0.4 mg/dL with baseline creatinine level of 1.4 mg/dL or less in men and 1.2 mg/dL or less in women and final creatinine level greater than these levels, and, in separate analyses, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decrease of 15 mL/min/1.73 m(2) or greater with baseline eGFR of 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) or greater and final eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2). Multivariable logistic regression to determine the association between WHR, BMI, and outcomes. Cox models to evaluate a secondary composite outcome of all-cause mortality and incident CKD. RESULTS: Of 13,324 individuals, mean WHR was 0.96 in men and 0.89 in women and mean BMI was 27.2 kg/m(2) in both men and women. During 9.3 years, 300 patients (2.3{\%}) in creatinine-based models and 710 patients (5.5{\%}) in eGFR-based models developed CKD. In creatinine-based models, each SD increase in WHR was associated with increased risk of incident CKD (odds ratio, 1.22; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 1.05 to 1.43) and the composite outcome (hazard ratio, 1.12; 95{\%} CI, 1.06 to 1.18), whereas each SD increase in BMI was not associated with CKD (odds ratio, 1.05; 95{\%} CI, 0.93 to 1.20) and appeared protective for the composite outcome (hazard ratio, 0.94; 95{\%} CI, 0.90 to 0.99). Results of eGFR-based models were similar. LIMITATIONS: Single measures of creatinine, no albuminuria data. CONCLUSIONS: WHR, but not BMI, is associated with incident CKD and mortality. Assessment of CKD risk should use WHR rather than BMI as an anthropomorphic measure of obesity.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Circulating C-reactive protein (CRP) is associated with the metabolic syndrome and might be causally linked to it. Our aim was to generate estimates of the association between plasma CRP and metabolic syndrome phenotypes that were free from confounding and reverse causation, to assess the causal role of this protein. METHODS: We examined associations between serum CRP concentration and metabolic syndrome phenotypes in the British Women's Heart and Health Study. We then compared these estimates with those derived from a mendelian randomised framework with common CRP gene haplotypes to generate unconfounded and unbiased estimates of any causal associations. FINDINGS: In a sample of British women, body-mass index (BMI), systolic blood pressure, waist-to-hip ratio, serum concentrations of HDL cholesterol and triglycerides, and insulin resistance were all associated with plasma CRP concentration. CRP haplotypes were associated with plasma CRP concentration (p{\textless}0.0001). With instrumental variable analyses, there was no association between plasma CRP concentration and any of the metabolic syndrome phenotypes analysed. There was strong evidence that linear regression and mendelian randomisation based estimation gave conflicting results for the CRP-BMI association (p=0.0002), and some evidence of conflicting results for the association of CRP with the score for insulin resistance (p=0.0139), triglycerides (p=0.0313), and HDL cholesterol (p=0.0688). INTERPRETATION: Disparity between estimates of the association between plasma CRP and phenotypes comprising the metabolic syndrome derived from conventional analyses and those from a mendelian randomisation approach suggests that there is no causal association between CRP and the metabolic syndrome phenotypes.},

abstract = {The Human Metabolome Database or HMDB (www.hmdb.ca) is a web-enabled metabolomic database containing comprehensive information about human metabolites along with their biological roles, physiological concentrations, disease associations, chemical reactions, metabolic pathways, and reference spectra. First described in 2007, the HMDB is now considered the standard metabolomic resource for human metabolic studies. Over the past decade the HMDB has continued to grow and evolve in response to emerging needs for metabolomics researchers and continuing changes in web standards. This year's update, HMDB 4.0, represents the most significant upgrade to the database in its history. For instance, the number of fully annotated metabolites has increased by nearly threefold, the number of experimental spectra has grown by almost fourfold and the number of illustrated metabolic pathways has grown by a factor of almost 60. Significant improvements have also been made to the HMDB's chemical taxonomy, chemical ontology, spectral viewing, and spectral/text searching tools. A great deal of brand new data has also been added to HMDB 4.0. This includes large quantities of predicted MS/MS and GC-MS reference spectral data as well as predicted (physiologically feasible) metabolite structures to facilitate novel metabolite identification. Additional information on metabolite-SNP interactions and the influence of drugs on metabolite levels (pharmacometabolomics) has also been added. Many other important improvements in the content, the interface, and the performance of the HMDB website have been made and these should greatly enhance its ease of use and its potential applications in nutrition, biochemistry, clinical chemistry, clinical genetics, medicine, and metabolomics science.},

abstract = {Obesity is a global health problem mainly attributed to lifestyle changes such as diet, low physical activity or socioeconomics factors. However, several evidences consistently showed that genetics contributes significantly to the weight-gain susceptibility.A systematic literature search of most relevant original, review and meta-analysis, restricted to English was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science and Google scholar up to May 2017 concerning the contribution of genetics and environmental factors to obesity.Several evidences suggest that obesogenic environments contribute to the development of an obese phenotype. However, not every individual from the same population, despite sharing the same obesogenic environment, develop obesity.After more than 10 years of investigation on the genetics of obesity, the variants found associated with obesity represent only 3{\%} of the estimated BMI-heritability, which is around 47–80{\%}. Moreover, genetic factors per se were unable to explain the rapid spread of obesity prevalence.The integration of multi-omics data enables scientists having a better picture and to elucidate unknown pathways contributing to obesity.New studies based on case–control or gene candidate approach will be important to identify new variants associated with obesity susceptibility and consequently unveiling its genetic architecture. This will lead to an improvement of our understanding about underlying mechanisms involved in development and origin of the actual obesity epidemic. The integration of several omics will also provide insights about the interplay between genes and environments contributing to the obese phenotype.},

abstract = {Adipose tissue expands to accommodate increased lipid through hypertrophy of existing adipocytes and by initiating differentiation of preadipocytes. The capacity of adipose tissue to expand is critical for accommodating changes in energy availability, but this capacity is not an unlimited process and likely varies between individuals. We suggest that it is not the absolute amount of adipose tissue but rather the capacity of adipose tissue to expand that affects metabolic homeostasis. Here we highlight examples of disease states and transgenic animal models with altered adipose tissue function that support this hypothesis and discuss possible mechanisms by which altered adipose tissue expandability impairs metabolic homeostasisClinical observations and experiments using genetically modified mouse models, some of which are discussed here, demonstrate that our understanding of how adipose tissue affects metabolic homeostasis is still developing. Although we know that obesity is a major health concern that predisposes individuals to many secondary conditions, including insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, we suggest that it is not the absolute amount of adipose tissue that determines the metabolic disruption, but rather limited expansion capacity of the adipose tissue (Figure 1). Identifying adipose tissue expandability as an important factor in preventing lipotox-icity and associated metabolic complications may introduce new therapeutic approaches that promote adipose tissue storage capacity. Although this is a counterintuitive suggestion for the treatment of obesity-related diabetes, this would expand the safe storage depot for lipid and prevent the accumulation of toxic lipid species in non-adipose tissues.},

abstract = {Mendelian randomization is the use of genetic variants as instrumental variables to estimate causal effects of risk factors on outcomes. The total causal effect of a risk factor is the change in the outcome resulting from intervening on the risk factor. This total causal effect may potentially encompass multiple mediating mechanisms. For a proposed mediator, the direct effect of the risk factor is the change in the outcome resulting from a change in the risk factor, keeping the mediator constant. A difference between the total effect and the direct effect indicates that the causal pathway from the risk factor to the outcome acts at least in part via the mediator (an indirect effect). Here, we show that Mendelian randomization estimates of total and direct effects can be obtained using summarized data on genetic associations with the risk factor, mediator, and outcome, potentially from different data sources. We perform simulations to test the validity of this approach when there is unmeasured confounding and/or bidirectional effects between the risk factor and mediator. We illustrate this method using the relationship between age at menarche and risk of breast cancer, with body mass index (BMI) as a potential mediator. We show an inverse direct causal effect of age at menarche on risk of breast cancer (independent of BMI), and a positive indirect effect via BMI. In conclusion, multivariable Mendelian randomization using summarized genetic data provides a rapid and accessible analytic strategy that can be undertaken using publicly available data to better understand causal mechanisms.},

abstract = {Adipose tissue morphology and release of free fatty acids, as well as peptide hormones, are believed to contribute to obesity and related metabolic disorders. These adipose tissue phenotypes are influenced by adiposity, but there is also a strong hereditary impact. Polymorphisms in numerous adipose-expressed genes have been evaluated for association with adipocyte and clinical phenotypes. In our opinion, some results are convincing. Thus ADRB2 and GPR74 genes are associated with adipocyte lipolysis, GPR74 also with BMI; PPARG and SREBP1, which promote adipogenesis and lipid storage, are associated with T2D and possible adiposity; ADIPOQ and ARL15 are associated with circulating levels of adiponectin, ARL15 also with coronary heart disease. We anticipate that the use of complementary approaches such as expression profiling and RNAi screening, and studies of additional levels of gene regulation, that is, miRNA and epigenetics, will be important to unravel the genetics of adipose tissue function.},

abstract = {Obesity is a risk factor for chronic kidney disease, and its prevalence among the elderly is increasing. We investigated the effects of changes in body fat percentage (BFP) on the longitudinal changes in the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in the elderly. This prospective cohort study included 390 participants aged {\textgreater}65 years who underwent bioelectrical impedance analysis at baseline and follow-up as a part of the Korean Longitudinal Study on Health and Aging. After a median follow-up period of 5.3 years, BFP was significantly higher than that at the start point (P{\textless}0.05). Participants who had the largest increase in BFP had the highest BMI and waist circumference (WC) (P{\textless}0.001). The highest tertile had the highest white blood cell count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, incidence of rapid progression, and decline in eGFR {\textgreater}25{\%} (P≤0.017, P = 0.025, P = 0.005, respectively). The lowest tertile had the lowest triglyceride and highest high-density lipoprotein levels (P{\textless}0.05). The adjusted decline rate in eGFR was correlated with a change in BFP (P = 0.039), but not with that in BMI or WC. The highest tertile had a 4.875-fold increase in the risk for rapid progression to a decline in eGFR (95{\%} CI: 1.366-17.397) and a 4.931-fold decrease in the risk to a decline in eGFR{\textgreater}25{\%} (95{\%} CI: 1.617-15.037), when compared with the lowest tertile. In subgroup analysis, the incidence of renal outcomes was significantly increased according to the increase in BFP in patients with lower eGFR (P≤0.010). A change in BFP may be associated with inflammation and dyslipidemia development, and longitudinal changes in body fat are related to a decrease in eGFR in the elderly.},

As a proportion of the total risk reduction, BMI was estimated to mediate 15{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval 13{\%} to 17{\%}) and 18{\%} (14{\%} to 23{\%}) in the observational and mendelian randomisation estimates, respectively. Corresponding estimates were 11{\%} (9{\%} to 13{\%}) and 21{\%} (15{\%} to 27{\%}) for systolic blood pressure and 19{\%} (15{\%} to 22{\%}) and 34{\%} (17{\%} to 50{\%}) for smoking behaviour. All three risk factors combined were estimated to mediate 42{\%} (36{\%} to 48{\%}) and 36{\%} (5{\%} to 68{\%}) of the effect of education on coronary heart disease in observational and mendelian randomisation analyses, respectively. Similar results were obtained when investigating the risk of stroke, myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular disease.Conclusions BMI, systolic blood pressure, and smoking behaviour mediate a substantial proportion of the protective effect of education on the risk of cardiovascular outcomes and intervening on these would lead to reductions in cases of cardiovascular disease attributable to lower levels of education. However, more than half of the protective effect of education remains unexplained and requires further investigation.},

abstract = {Associations between modifiable exposures and disease seen in observational epidemiology are sometimes confounded and thus misleading, despite our best efforts to improve the design and analysis of studies. Mendelian randomization—the random assortment of genes from parents to offspring that occurs during gamete formation and conception—provides one method for assessing the causal nature of some environmental exposures. The association between a disease and a polymorphism that mimics the biological link between a proposed exposure and disease is not generally susceptible to the reverse causation or confounding that may distort interpretations of conventional observational studies. Several examples where the phenotypic effects of polymorphisms are well documented provide encouraging evidence of the explanatory power of Mendelian randomization and are described. The limitations of the approach include confounding by polymorphisms in linkage disequilibrium with the polymorphism under study, that polymorphisms may have several phenotypic effects associated with disease, the lack of suitable polymorphisms for studying modifiable exposures of interest, and canalization—the buffering of the effects of genetic variation during development. Nevertheless, Mendelian randomization provides new opportunities to test causality and demonstrates how investment in the human genome project may contribute to understanding and preventing the adverse effects on human health of modifiable exposures.Genetic epidemiology—the theme of this issue of the International Journal of Epidemiology—is seen by many to be the only future for epidemiology, perhaps reflecting a growing awareness of the limitations of observational epidemiology1 (Box 1). Genetic epidemiology is concerned with understanding heritable aspects of disease risk, individual susceptibility to disease, and ultimately with contributing to a comprehensive molecular understanding of pathogenesis. The massive investment and expansion of human genetics, if it is to return value for the common good, must be integrated into public health functions. The human genome epidemiology network (HuGE Net—http://www.cdc.gov/genetics/huge.htm) has been established to promote the use of genetic knowledge—in terms of genetic tests and services—for disease prevention and health promotion.2,3 A broad taxonomy of human genome studies of public health relevance has been developed4 (Box 2). In this issue of the IJE, we publish a paper by Miguel Porta,5 who highlights the need for a more rational approach to genetic testing, given the likely low penetrance of many genes associated with cancers,6 likening the role of the genome to a jazz score that is interpreted and developed through experience and context—and is seldom predictable. Such insights may well temper enthusiasm for genetic testing in populations. However, in parallel to the approaches advocated by HuGE, genetic epidemiology can lead to a more robust understanding of environmental determinants of disease (e.g. dietary factors, occupational exposures, and health-related behaviours) relevant to whole populations (and not simply to genetically susceptible sub-populations).7–10 This approach has recently been referred to as ‘Mendelian randomization'.11–15 Here we begin by briefly reviewing reasons for current concerns about aetiological findings generated by conventional observational epidemiology and then we outline the potential contribution (and limitations) of Mendelian randomization.Box 1 ‘Epidemiology set to get fast-track treatment'‘A consortium of leading European research centres and pharmaceutical companies will this week announce a plan to transform epidemiology by combining it with the new techniques of high-throughput biology. They plan to create a new field of study—genomic epidemiology—by using screening technologies derived from the human genome project {\ldots} We think it is important to expand classical epidemiology and genetic epidemiology to take it to this high-throughput mode, says Esper Boel, vice-president of biotechnology research at Novo Nordisk.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To conduct a systematic review of cross-sectional and prospective human studies evaluating metabolite markers identified using high-throughput metabolomics techniques on prediabetes and type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE databases through August 2015. We conducted a qualitative review of cross-sectional and prospective studies. Additionally, meta-analyses of metabolite markers, with data estimates from at least three prospective studies, and type 2 diabetes risk were conducted, and multivariable-adjusted relative risks of type 2 diabetes were calculated per study-specific SD difference in a given metabolite. RESULTS: We identified 27 cross-sectional and 19 prospective publications reporting associations of metabolites and prediabetes and/or type 2 diabetes. Carbohydrate (glucose and fructose), lipid (phospholipids, sphingomyelins, and triglycerides), and amino acid (branched-chain amino acids, aromatic amino acids, glycine, and glutamine) metabolites were higher in individuals with type 2 diabetes compared with control subjects. Prospective studies provided evidence that blood concentrations of several metabolites, including hexoses, branched-chain amino acids, aromatic amino acids, phospholipids, and triglycerides, were associated with the incidence of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes. We meta-analyzed results from eight prospective studies that reported risk estimates for metabolites and type 2 diabetes, including 8,000 individuals of whom 1,940 had type 2 diabetes. We found 36{\%} higher risk of type 2 diabetes per study-specific SD difference for isoleucine (pooled relative risk 1.36 [1.24-1.48]; I(2) = 9.5{\%}), 36{\%} for leucine (1.36 [1.17-1.58]; I(2) = 37.4{\%}), 35{\%} for valine (1.35 [1.19-1.53]; I(2) = 45.8{\%}), 36{\%} for tyrosine (1.36 [1.19-1.55]; I(2) = 51.6{\%}), and 26{\%} for phenylalanine (1.26 [1.10-1.44]; I(2) = 56{\%}). Glycine and glutamine were inversely associated with type 2 diabetes risk (0.89 [0.81-0.96] and 0.85 [0.82-0.89], respectively; both I(2) = 0.0{\%}). CONCLUSIONS: In studies using high-throughput metabolomics, several blood amino acids appear to be consistently associated with the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.},

OBJECTIVE: We investigated the association of BMI (in kg/m(2)), waist circumference, and waist-hip ratio (WHR) with mortality and cause-specific mortality. DESIGN: Subjects aged {\textgreater}/=75 y (n = 14 833) from 53 family practices in the United Kingdom underwent a health assessment that included measurement of BMI and waist and hip circumferences; they also were followed up for mortality. RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 5.9 y, 6649 subjects died (46{\%} of circulatory causes). In nonsmoking men and women (90{\%} of the cohort), compared with the lowest quintile of BMI ({\textless}23 in men and {\textless}22.3 in women), adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for mortality were {\textless}1 for all other quintiles of BMI (P for trend = 0.0003 and 0.0001 in men and women, respectively). Increasing WHR was associated with increasing HRs in men and women (P for trend = 0.008 and 0.0002, respectively). BMI was not associated with circulatory mortality in men (P for trend = 0.667) and was negatively associated in women (P for trend = 0.004). WHR was positively related to circulatory mortality in both men and women (P for trend = 0.001 and 0.005, respectively). Waist circumference was not associated with all-cause or circulatory mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Current guidelines for BMI-based risk categories overestimate risks due to excess weight in persons aged {\textgreater}/=75 y. Increased mortality risk is more clearly indicated for relative abdominal obesity as measured by high WHR.},

By considering the cancer risk in first-degree relatives of mutation-positive and -negative probands as a weighted average of the risk in carriers and noncarriers, with weights calculated assuming a known mode of inheritance, one can infer the penetrance of the mutations. The estimates of penetrance by age 70 years for three specific mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes common among Ashkenazi Jews for the first occurrence of breast or ovary cancer is 63{\%}. The kin-cohort design can be a useful tool for quickly estimating penetrance from volunteers in a setting in which the mutation prevalence is relatively high.},

The study population consisted of 26,607 participants from the Alberta's Tomorrow Project cohort. Two main measures of body shape and size were examined: i) body mass index (BMI) and ii) waist circumference (WC). Incident cancers were identified via linkage to the Alberta Cancer Registry. Cox proportional hazards models were used. Males and females classified as obese (BMI ≥ 30 kg /m−2) have a 33{\%} and 22{\%} increased risk of all-cancer, respectively, than their normal weight counterparts. Similar all-cancer risk increases are observed for those above sex-specific WC guidelines. Mutual adjustment for WC attenuates the association between BMI and all-cancer risk, especially among females. Central adiposity appears to be a stronger predictor of all-cancer risk than body size.},

abstract = {Genomic data visualization is essential for interpretation and hypothesis generation as well as a valuable aid in communicating discoveries. Visual tools bridge the gap between algorithmic approaches and the cognitive skills of investigators. Addressing this need has become crucial in genomics, as biomedical research is increasingly data‐driven and many studies lack well‐defined hypotheses. A key challenge in data‐driven research is to discover unexpected patterns and to formulate hypotheses in an unbiased manner in vast amounts of genomic and other associated data. Over the past two decades, this has driven the development of numerous data visualization techniques and tools for visualizing genomic data. Based on a comprehensive literature survey, we propose taxonomies for data, visualization, and tasks involved in genomic data visualization. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive review of published genomic visualization tools in the context of the proposed taxonomies.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Adiponectin, a circulating adipocyte-derived protein, has insulin-sensitizing, anti-inflammatory, antiatherogenic, and cardiomyocyte-protective properties in animal models. However, the systemic effects of adiponectin in humans are unknown. Our aims were to define the metabolic profile associated with higher blood adiponectin concentration and investigate whether variation in adiponectin concentration affects the systemic metabolic profile. METHODS AND RESULTS: We applied multivariable regression in ≤5909 adults and Mendelian randomization (using cis-acting genetic variants in the vicinity of the adiponectin gene as instrumental variables) for analyzing the causal effect of adiponectin in the metabolic profile of ≤37 545 adults. Participants were largely European from 6 longitudinal studies and 1 genome-wide association consortium. In the multivariable regression analyses, higher circulating adiponectin was associated with higher high-density lipoprotein lipids and lower very-low-density lipoprotein lipids, glucose levels, branched-chain amino acids, and inflammatory markers. However, these findings were not supported by Mendelian randomization analyses for most metabolites. Findings were consistent between sexes and after excluding high-risk groups (defined by age and occurrence of previous cardiovascular event) and 1 study with admixed population. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that blood adiponectin concentration is more likely to be an epiphenomenon in the context of metabolic disease than a key determinant.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The main associations of body-mass index (BMI) with overall and cause-specific mortality can best be assessed by long-term prospective follow-up of large numbers of people. The Prospective Studies Collaboration aimed to investigate these associations by sharing data from many studies. METHODS: Collaborative analyses were undertaken of baseline BMI versus mortality in 57 prospective studies with 894 576 participants, mostly in western Europe and North America (61{\%} [n=541 452] male, mean recruitment age 46 [SD 11] years, median recruitment year 1979 [IQR 1975-85], mean BMI 25 [SD 4] kg/m(2)). The analyses were adjusted for age, sex, smoking status, and study. To limit reverse causality, the first 5 years of follow-up were excluded, leaving 66 552 deaths of known cause during a mean of 8 (SD 6) further years of follow-up (mean age at death 67 [SD 10] years): 30 416 vascular; 2070 diabetic, renal or hepatic; 22 592 neoplastic; 3770 respiratory; 7704 other. FINDINGS: In both sexes, mortality was lowest at about 22.5-25 kg/m(2). Above this range, positive associations were recorded for several specific causes and inverse associations for none, the absolute excess risks for higher BMI and smoking were roughly additive, and each 5 kg/m(2) higher BMI was on average associated with about 30{\%} higher overall mortality (hazard ratio per 5 kg/m(2) [HR] 1.29 [95{\%} CI 1.27-1.32]): 40{\%} for vascular mortality (HR 1.41 [1.37-1.45]); 60-120{\%} for diabetic, renal, and hepatic mortality (HRs 2.16 [1.89-2.46], 1.59 [1.27-1.99], and 1.82 [1.59-2.09], respectively); 10{\%} for neoplastic mortality (HR 1.10 [1.06-1.15]); and 20{\%} for respiratory and for all other mortality (HRs 1.20 [1.07-1.34] and 1.20 [1.16-1.25], respectively). Below the range 22.5-25 kg/m(2), BMI was associated inversely with overall mortality, mainly because of strong inverse associations with respiratory disease and lung cancer. These inverse associations were much stronger for smokers than for non-smokers, despite cigarette consumption per smoker varying little with BMI. INTERPRETATION: Although other anthropometric measures (eg, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio) could well add extra information to BMI, and BMI to them, BMI is in itself a strong predictor of overall mortality both above and below the apparent optimum of about 22.5-25 kg/m(2). The progressive excess mortality above this range is due mainly to vascular disease and is probably largely causal. At 30-35 kg/m(2), median survival is reduced by 2-4 years; at 40-45 kg/m(2), it is reduced by 8-10 years (which is comparable with the effects of smoking). The definite excess mortality below 22.5 kg/m(2) is due mainly to smoking-related diseases, and is not fully explained.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: Liver disease is traditionally categorized as alcoholic and non-alcoholic. We studied various risk factors predictive of advanced non-viral liver disease in general population and analyzed the interaction between these factors and alcohol consumption. METHODS: Persons without underlying liver disease who participated in the Health2000 or FINRISK studies 1992-2012 comprised a cohort of 41 260 individuals. Pattern of alcohol consumption and metabolic, lifestyle-related, and anthropometric parameters were analyzed with Cox regression analysis using severe liver disease hospitalization, cancer, or death as end-point. Viral liver diseases were excluded. RESULTS: A total of 355 liver events occurred during the mean 12.4-year follow-up (511 789 person-years). In the multivariate model, age (hazard ratio [HR] 1.03, P = 0.0083 for men; HR 1.04, P = 0.0198 for women), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) (HR 1.52, P = 0.0006 for men; HR 1.58, P = 0.0167 for women), patatin-like phospholipase-containing domain 3 mutations (HR 1.9, P = 0.024 for men; HR 2.7, P = 0.0109 for women), and weekly binge drinking (HR 2.4, P = 0.0024 for men; HR 7.4, P {\textless} 0.0001 for women) predicted development of severe liver disease. Among men, diabetes (HR 2.7, P = 0.0002), average alcohol consumption (HR for 10 g/day 1.1, P = 0.0022), non-married status (HR 1.9, P = 0.0397 for single; HR 2.4, P = 0.0002 for widowed/separated), and serum high-density lipoprotein (HR 2.2, P = 0.0022) and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HR 1.2, P = 0.0237) were additional risk factors. Alcohol intake increased the risk especially among persons with high WHR (P for interaction 0.009). CONCLUSIONS: Age, patatin-like phospholipase-containing domain 3 haplotype, and WHR increase the risk for development of severe liver disease. We found strong synergism between alcohol and central obesity. Binge drinking is an additional risk factor.},

However, obesity's influence on dementia remains poorly understood. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis. PUBMED search (1995-2007) resulted in 10 relevant prospective cohort studies of older adults (40-80 years at baseline) with end points being dementia and predictors including adiposity measures, such as body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC). There was a significant U-shaped association between BMI and dementia (P = 0.034), with dementia risk increased for obesity and underweight. Pooled odds ratios (OR) and 95{\%} confidence intervals (CI) for underweight, overweight and obesity compared with normal weight in relation to incident dementia were: 1.36 (1.07, 1.73), 0.88 (0.60, 1.27) and 1.42 (0.93, 2.18) respectively. Pooled ORs and 95{\%} CI for obesity and incident Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia were 1.80 (1.00, 3.29) vs. 1.73 (0.47, 6.31) and were stronger in studies with long follow-up ({\textgreater}10 years) and young baseline age ({\textless}60 years). Weight gain and high WC or skin-fold thickness increased risks of dementia in all included studies. The meta-analysis shows a moderate association between obesity and the risks for dementia and AD.

Here, using genome-wide association meta-analysis of 606,059 parents' survival, we discover two regions associated with longevity (HLA-DQA1/DRB1 and LPA). We also validate previous suggestions that APOE, CHRNA3/5, CDKN2A/B, SH2B3 and FOXO3A influence longevity. Next we show that giving up smoking, educational attainment, openness to new experience and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels are most positively genetically correlated with lifespan while susceptibility to coronary artery disease (CAD), cigarettes smoked per day, lung cancer, insulin resistance and body fat are most negatively correlated. We suggest that the effect of education on lifespan is principally mediated through smoking while the effect of obesity appears to act via CAD. Using instrumental variables, we suggest that an increase of one body mass index unit reduces lifespan by 7 months while 1 year of education adds 11 months to expected lifespan.Variability in human longevity is genetically influenced. Using genetic data of parental lifespan, the authors identify associations at HLA-DQA/DRB1 and LPA and find that genetic variants that increase educational attainment have a positive effect on lifespan whereas increasing BMI negatively affects lifespan.},

Furthermore, it has been shown that GIMs provide testable hypotheses for functional genomics and metabolomics and for the identification of novel gene functions and metabolite identities. mGWAS with growing sample sizes and increasingly complex metabolic trait panels are being conducted, allowing for more comprehensive and systems-based downstream analyses. The generated large datasets of genetic associations can now be mined by the biomedical research community and provide valuable resources for hypothesis-driven studies.

Between 1986 and 1992, the authors studied a total of 202 black and 504 white men and women who resided in or near New York City, were ages 20–94 years, and had BMIs of 18–35 kg/m2. Total body fat, expressed as a percentage of body weight (BF{\%}), was assessed using a four-compartment body composition model that does not rely on assumptions known to be age, sex, or ethnicity dependent. Statistically significant age dependencies were observed in the BF{\%}-BMI relations in all four sex and ethnic groups (p values {\textless} 0.05–0.001) with older persons showing a higher BF{\%} compared with younger persons with comparable BMIs. Statistically significant sex effects were also observed in BF{\%}-BMI relations within each ethnic group (p values {\textless} 0.001) after controlling first for age. For an equivalent BMI, women have significantly greater amounts of total body fat than do men throughout the entire adult life span. Ethnicity did not significantly influence the BF{\%}-BMI relation after controlling first for age and sex even though both black women and men had longer appendicular bone lengths relative to stature (p values {\textless} 0.001 and 0.02, respectively) compared with white women and men. Body mass index alone accounted for 25{\%} of between individual differences in body fat percentage for the 706 total subjects; adding age and sex as independent variables to the regression model increased the variance (r2) to 67{\%}. These results suggest that BMI is age and sex dependent when used as an indicator of body fatness, but that it is ethnicity independent in black and white adults.},

For weight maintenance, not only does energy intake have to match energy expenditure, but also macronutrient intake must balance macronutrient oxidation. However, this equilibrium seems to be particularly difficult to achieve in individuals with low fat oxidation, low energy expenditure, low sympathetic activity or low levels of spontaneous physical activity, as in addition to excess energy intake, all of these factors explain the tendency of some people to gain weight. Additionally, large variability in weight change is observed when energy surplus is imposed experimentally or spontaneously. Clearly, the data suggest a strong genetic influence on body weight regulation implying a normal physiology in an 'obesogenic' environment. In this study, we also review evidence that carbohydrate balance may represent the potential signal that regulates energy homeostasis by impacting energy intake and body weight. Because of the small storage capacity for carbohydrate and its importance for metabolism in many tissues and organs, carbohydrate balance must be maintained at a given level. This drive for balance may in turn cause increased energy intake when consuming a diet high in fat and low in carbohydrate. If sustained over time, such an increase in energy intake cannot be detected by available methods, but may cause meaningful increases in body weight. The concept of metabolic flexibility and its impact on body weight regulation is also presented.},

abstract = {Obesity increases a number of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, but patients with many types of CVD may have a better prognosis if classified as overweight or obese, a phenomenon known as the “obesity paradox”. This paradoxical benefit of a medically unfavorable phenotype is particularly strong in the overweight and class I obesity, and less pronounced in the more severe or morbidly obese populations (class II–III and greater). Rather than an obesity paradox, it is possible that this phenomenon may represent a “lean paradox”, in which individuals classified as normal weight or underweight may have a poorer prognosis with respect to CVD, as a result of a progressive catabolic state and lean mass loss. Cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) is a fundamental part of this discussion. A greater CRF is associated with lower CVD risk, regardless of body mass index (BMI). Also, the assessment of body composition compartments (i.e., fat mass, fat-free mass, lean mass) and the presence of metabolic derangements may be better indicators of CVD risk than BMI alone. The focus of this review is to summarize the current evidence of the obesity paradox. Moreover, we discuss the utility and limitations of BMI for cardiometabolic risk stratification, in addition to concepts such as “metabolically healthy obesity” (MHO) and the “fat but fit” phenomenon, which describe patients who are diagnosed with obesity using BMI, but without major metabolic derangements and with greater CRF, respectively. Finally, we propose that obese patients presenting with an excess body fat, yet without metabolic abnormalities, should still be viewed as an “at risk” population, and as such should receive advice to change their lifestyle to improve their CRF and to prevent the development of impaired fasting glucose, diabetes mellitus and other CVD risk factors as a form of primary prevention.},

abstract = {The body possesses an energy homeostasis system by which it adjusts food intake to match calories burned to keep body weight stableThe hormone leptin, which is made by adipose tissue in approximate proportion to fat stores, plays an important role in the control of energy homeostasis. When fat stores are expended, leptin falls, causing an increase in appetite and diminishing energy expenditure to return fat stores to their previous levelsBecause obesity results from the accretion of adipose tissue fat stores, leptin levels are high in obesity. The failure of this high leptin (and therapy with exogenous leptin) in the obese state to decrease feeding and return adipose mass to normal has suggested the existence of leptin resistance, in which obesity impairs leptin actionObesity provokes a number of changes to hypothalamic anatomy and physiology, many of which have been invoked as potential mediators of leptin resistance. These include the leptin-induced expression of leptin signalling inhibitors, hypothalamic inflammatory signalling and gliosis and endoplasmic reticulum stressA variety of data suggest that early steps in leptin signalling are appropriately enhanced in response to the high leptin levels in obesity and that elevated leptin itself may attenuate downstream leptin action. Hence, the failure of leptin to decrease food intake and body weight in obesity may result from high leptin levels producing changes that act downstream of the initial steps in leptin signalling to create a functional ceiling for leptin actionThe available data suggest that leptin functions primarily in defence against decreased body weight rather than in limiting increases in body weight},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Growing evidence suggests that abdominal obesity is a more important risk factor for the prognosis of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases than BMI. Somatic-affective symptoms of depression have also been linked to cardiovascular risk. The relationship between obesity and depression, however, has remained contradictory. Our aim was therefore to relate body mass index (BMI) and different measures for abdominal obesity (waist circumference, WC, waist-to-hip ratio, WHR, waist-to-height ratio, WHtR) to somatic vs. cognitive-affective symptoms of depression. METHODS: In a cross-sectional population based study, data on the first N = 5000 participants enrolled in the Gutenberg Health Study (GHS) are reported. To analyze the relationship between depression and obesity, we computed linear regression models with the anthropometric measure (BMI, WC, WHR, WHtR) as the dependent variable and life style factors, cardiovascular risk factors and psychotropic medications as potential confounders of obesity/depression. RESULTS: We found that only the somatic, but not the cognitive-affective symptoms of depression are consistently positively associated with anthropometric measures of obesity. CONCLUSIONS: We could demonstrate that the somatic-affective symptoms of depression rather than the cognitive-affective symptoms are strongly related to anthropometric measures. This is also true for younger obese starting at the age of 35 years. Our results are in line with previous studies indicating that visceral adipose tissue plays a key role in the relationship between obesity, depression and cardiovascular disease.},

abstract = {Adipose tissue is now recognised as a highly active metabolic and endocrine organ. Great strides have been made in uncovering the multiple functions of the adipocyte in cellular and molecular detail, but it is essential to remember that adipose tissue normally operates as a structured whole. Its functions are regulated by multiple external influences such as autonomic nervous system activity, the rate of blood flow and the delivery of a complex mix of substrates and hormones in the plasma. Attempting to understand how all these factors converge and regulate adipose tissue function is a prime example of integrative physiology. Adipose tissue metabolism is extremely dynamic, and the supply of and removal of substrates in the blood is acutely regulated according to the nutritional state. Adipose tissue possesses the ability to a very large extent to modulate its own metabolic activities, including differentiation of new adipocytes and production of blood vessels as necessary to accommodate increasing fat stores. At the same time, adipocytes signal to other tissues to regulate their energy metabolism in accordance with the body's nutritional state. Ultimately adipocyte fat stores have to match the body's overall surplus or deficit of energy. This implies the existence of one (or more) signal(s) to the adipose tissue that reflects the body's energy status, and points once again to the need for an integrative view of adipose tissue function.},

Body mass index was calculated from measured height and weight; percent fat, percent trunk fat, and appendicular lean mass were measured with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Pearson partial correlations between body composition measures and metabolites were adjusted for age, study site, and smoking. Out of 350 metabolites, body mass index, percent fat, percent trunk fat, and appendicular lean mass were significantly correlated with 92, 48, 96, and 43 metabolites at p less than .0014. Metabolites most strongly correlated with body composition included carnitine, a marker of fatty acid oxidation (positively correlated), triacylglycerols (positively correlated), and amino acids including branched-chain amino acids (positively correlated except for acetylglycine and serine). Gaussian Graphical Models of metabolites found that 25 lipid metabolites clustered into a single network. Groups of five amino acids, three plasmalogens, and two carnitines were also observed. Findings confirm prior reports of associations between amino acids, lean mass, and fat mass in addition to associations not previously reported.

Mediation approaches used in conventional epidemiology have been adapted to understanding the role of molecular intermediates in situations of high-dimensional omics data with varying degrees of success. In particular, the limitations of observational epidemiological study including confounding, reverse causation and measurement error can afflict conventional mediation approaches and may lead to incorrect conclusions regarding causal effects. Solutions to analysing mediation which overcome these problems include the use of instrumental variable methods such as Mendelian randomization, which may be applied to evaluate causality in increasingly complex networks of omics data.},

During a mean of 21.4 years of follow-up, 12 356 deaths were identified. A J shaped association was consistently observed between BMI and all cause mortality. Multivariable adjusted Cox models including predicted fat mass and lean body mass showed a strong positive monotonic association between predicted fat mass and all cause mortality. Compared with those in the lowest fifth of predicted fat mass, men in the highest fifth had a hazard ratio of 1.35 (95{\%} confidence interval 1.26 to 1.46) for mortality from all causes. In contrast, a U shaped association was found between predicted lean body mass and all cause mortality. Compared with those in the lowest fifth of predicted lean body mass, men in the second to fourth fifths had 8-10{\%} lower risk of mortality from all causes. In the restricted cubic spline models, the risk of all cause mortality was relatively flat until 21 kg of predicted fat mass and increased rapidly afterwards, with a hazard ratio of 1.22 (1.18 to 1.26) per standard deviation. For predicted lean body mass, a large reduction of the risk was seen within the lower range until 56 kg, with a hazard ratio of 0.87 (0.82 to 0.92) per standard deviation, which increased thereafter (P for non-linearity {\&}lt;0.001). For cause specific mortality, men in the highest fifth of predicted fat mass had hazard ratios of 1.67 (1.47 to 1.89) for cardiovascular disease, 1.24 (1.09 to 1.43) for cancer, and 1.26 (0.97 to 1.64) for respiratory disease. On the other hand, a U shaped association was found between predicted lean body mass and mortality from cardiovascular disease and cancer. However, a strong inverse association existed between predicted lean body mass and mortality from respiratory disease (P for trend {\&}lt;0.001).Conclusions The shape of the association between BMI and mortality was determined by the relation between two body components (lean body mass and fat mass) and mortality. This finding suggests that the “obesity paradox” controversy may be largely explained by low lean body mass, rather than low fat mass, in the lower range of BMI.},

abstract = {Summary The WHO 2016 report indicates that worldwide obesity is rising, with over 600 million people in the obese range (BMI{\textgreater}30). The recommended daily calorie intake for adults is 2000 kcal and 2500 kcal for women and men respectively. The average American consumes 3770 kcal/day and the average person in the UK consumes 3400 kcal/day. With such increased caloric intake, there is an increased load on metabolic pathways, in particular glucose metabolism. Such metabolism requires micronutrients as enzyme co-factors. The recommended daily allowance (RDA) for thiamine is 1.3 mg/day and 0.5 mg thiamine is required to process 1000 kilocalories (kcal). Therefore, despite the appearance of being overfed, there is now increasing evidence that the obese population may nutritionally depleted of essential micronutrients. Thiamine deficiency has been reported to be in the region of 16–47{\%} among patients undergoing bariatric surgery for obesity. Thiamine, in turn, requires magnesium to be in its active form thiamine diphosphate, (TDP). TDP also requires magnesium to achieve activation of TDP dependent enzymes, including transketolase (TK), pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and alpha-keto glutaric acid dehydrogenase (AKGDH), during metabolism of glucose. Thiamine and magnesium therefore play a critical role in glucose metabolism and their deficiency may result in the accumulation of anaerobic metabolites including lactate due to a mismatch between caloric burden and function of thiamine dependent enzymes. It may therefore be postulated that thiamine and magnesium deficiency are under-recognized in obesity and may be important in the progress of obesity and obesity related chronic disease states. The aim of the present systematic review was to examine the role of thiamine dependent enzymes in obesity and obesity related chronic disease states.},

We find that obesity results in profound perturbation of the metabolome; nearly a third of the assayed metabolites associated with changes in BMI. A metabolome signature identifies the healthy obese and lean individuals with abnormal metabolomes-these groups differ in health outcomes and underlying genetic risk. Specifically, an abnormal metabolome associated with a 2- to 5-fold increase in cardiovascular events when comparing individuals who were matched for BMI but had opposing metabolome signatures.

The discovery of leptin has led to realizations that have established adipose tissue as an endocrine organ, secreting bioactive molecules including hormones now termed adipokines. Through adipokines, the adipose tissue influences the regulation of several important physiological functions including but not limited to appetite, satiety, energy expenditure, activity, insulin sensitivity and secretion, glucose and lipid metabolism, fat distribution, endothelial function, hemostasis, blood pressure, neuroendocrine regulation, and function of the immune system. Adipokines have a great potential for clinical use as potential therapeutics for obesity, obesity related metabolic, cardiovascular and other diseases. After 20 years of intense research efforts, recombinant leptin and the leptin analog metreleptin are already available for the treatment of congenital leptin deficiency and lipodystrophy. Other adipokines are also emerging as promising candidates for urgently needed novel pharmacological treatment strategies not only in obesity but also other disease states associated with and influenced by adipose tissue size and activity. In addition, prediction of reduced type 2 diabetes risk by high circulating adiponectin concentrations suggests that adipokines have the potential to be used as biomarkers for individual treatment success and disease progression, to monitor clinical responses and to identify non-responders to anti-obesity interventions. With the growing number of adipokines there is an increasing need to define their function, molecular targets and translational potential for the treatment of obesity and other diseases. In this review we present research data on adipose tissue secreted hormones, the discovery of which followed the discovery of leptin 20 years ago pointing to future research directions to unravel mechanisms of action for adipokines.},

Our tool is effective in displaying variation in genome structure and, generally, any other kind of positional relationships between genomic intervals. Such data are routinely produced by sequence alignments, hybridization arrays, genome mapping, and genotyping studies. Circos uses a circular ideogram layout to facilitate the display of relationships between pairs of positions by the use of ribbons, which encode the position, size, and orientation of related genomic elements. Circos is capable of displaying data as scatter, line, and histogram plots, heat maps, tiles, connectors, and text. Bitmap or vector images can be created from GFF-style data inputs and hierarchical configuration files, which can be easily generated by automated tools, making Circos suitable for rapid deployment in data analysis and reporting pipelines.},

Epigenetic markers, like any other molecular biomarker, are vulnerable to confounding and reverse causation. Here, we present a strategy, based on the well-established framework of Mendelian randomization, to interrogate the causal relationships between exposure, DNA methylation and outcome. The two-step approach first uses a genetic proxy for the exposure of interest to assess the causal relationship between exposure and methylation. A second step then utilizes a genetic proxy for DNA methylation to interrogate the causal relationship between DNA methylation and outcome. The rationale, origins, methodology, advantages and limitations of this novel strategy are presented.},

In recent years, it has been used to combine genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary data for large numbers of genetic variants. Heterogeneity among the causal estimates obtained from multiple genetic variants points to a possible violation of the necessary instrumental variable assumptions. In this article, we provide a basic introduction to MR and the instrumental variable theory that it relies upon.

abstract = {The informativeness of blood pressure, obesity and serum lipids associated with cardiovascular events may depend on how the indices are expressed, and mid blood pressure, waist-to-hip ratio adjusted for body-mass index (BMI) and the ratio of total to HDL cholesterol may be more informative than other expressions. Our aim was to study the informativeness of indices of blood pressure, obesity and serum lipids associated with ischaemic heart disease mortality in a large, homogeneous population. Blood pressure, weight, height, waist and hip circumference, total and HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides were measured at baseline (1995-1997) in 28,158 men and 32,573 women. Information on deaths from ischaemic heart disease (IHD) was obtained from the Causes of Death Registry in Norway from baseline until the end of 2007. Informativeness was analysed using the difference in twice the log-likelihood of a Cox model with and without each index. During 11 years of follow-up, 597 men and 418 women had died from IHD. Systolic blood pressure in men and pulse pressure in women were the most informative predictors of blood pressure, and waist-to-hip ratio adjusted for BMI was the most informative expression of obesity in both men and women. Among serum lipids, the most informative predictor was the ratio of total cholesterol to HDL cholesterol. Using more informative expressions of conventional risk factors for ischemic heart disease may improve both the validity and precision of estimates of risk, and may be useful both clinically and for preventive purposes.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: A high body mass index (BMI) is a major risk factor for several chronic diseases, but the biology underlying these associations is not well-understood. Dyslipidemia, inflammation, and elevated levels of growth factors and sex steroid hormones explain some of the increased disease risk, but other metabolic factors not yet identified may also play a role. DESIGN: In order to discover novel metabolic biomarkers of BMI, we used non-targeted metabolomics to assay 317 metabolites in blood samples from 947 participants and examined the cross-sectional associations between metabolite levels and BMI. Participants were from three studies in the United States and China. Height, weight, and potential confounders were ascertained by questionnaire (US studies) or direct measurement (Chinese study). Metabolite levels were measured using liquid-phase chromatography and gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. We evaluated study-specific associations using linear regression, adjusted for age, gender, and smoking, and we estimated combined associations using random effects meta-analysis. RESULTS: The meta-analysis revealed 37 metabolites significantly associated with BMI, including 19 lipids, 12 amino acids, and 6 others, at the Bonferroni significance threshold (p{\textless}0.00016). Eighteen of these associations had not been previously reported, including histidine, an amino acid neurotransmitter, and butyrylcarnitine, a lipid marker of whole-body fatty acid oxidation. Heterogeneity by study was minimal (all P(heterogeneity) {\textgreater}0.05). In total, 110 metabolites were associated with BMI at the p{\textless}0.05 level. CONCLUSION: These findings establish a baseline for the BMI metabolome, and suggest new targets for researchers attempting to clarify mechanistic links between high BMIs and disease risk.},

abstract = {Mendelian randomization (MR) uses genetic data to probe questions of causality in epidemiological research, by invoking the Instrumental Variable (IV) assumptions. In recent years, it has become commonplace to attempt MR analyses by synthesising summary data estimates of genetic association gleaned from large and independent study populations. This is referred to as two-sample summary data MR. Unfortunately, due to the sheer number of variants that can be easily included into summary data MR analyses, it is increasingly likely that some do not meet the IV assumptions due to pleiotropy. There is a pressing need to develop methods that can both detect and correct for pleiotropy, in order to preserve the validity of the MR approach in this context. In this paper, we aim to clarify how established methods of meta-regression and random effects modelling from mainstream meta-analysis are being adapted to perform this task. Specifically, we focus on two contrastin g approaches: the Inverse Variance Weighted (IVW) method which assumes in its simplest form that all genetic variants are valid IVs, and the method of MR-Egger regression that allows all variants to violate the IV assumptions, albeit in a specific way. We investigate the ability of two popular random effects models to provide robustness to pleiotropy under the IVW approach, and propose statistics to quantify the relative goodness-of-fit of the IVW approach over MR-Egger regression. {\textcopyright} 2017 The Authors.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Metabolite levels within an individual vary over time. This within-individual variability, coupled with technical variability, reduces the power for epidemiologic studies to detect associations with disease. Here, the authors assess the variability of a large subset of metabolites and evaluate the implications for epidemiologic studies. METHODS: Using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) and gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC/MS) platforms, 385 metabolites were measured in 60 women at baseline and year-one of the Shanghai Physical Activity Study, and observed patterns were confirmed in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening study. RESULTS: Although the authors found high technical reliability (median intraclass correlation = 0.8), reliability over time within an individual was low. Taken together, variability in the assay and variability within the individual accounted for the majority of variability for 64{\%} of metabolites. Given this, a metabolite would need, on average, a relative risk of 3 (comparing upper and lower quartiles of "usual" levels) or 2 (comparing quartiles of observed levels) to be detected in 38{\%}, 74{\%}, and 97{\%} of studies including 500, 1,000, and 5,000 individuals. Age, gender, and fasting status factors, which are often of less interest in epidemiologic studies, were associated with 30{\%}, 67{\%}, and 34{\%} of metabolites, respectively, but the associations were weak and explained only a small proportion of the total metabolite variability. CONCLUSION: Metabolomics will require large, but feasible, sample sizes to detect the moderate effect sizes typical for epidemiologic studies. IMPACT: We offer guidelines for determining the sample sizes needed to conduct metabolomic studies in epidemiology.},

This has been extended to multivariable MR (MVMR) to estimate the effect of two or more exposures on an outcome.We use simulations and theory to clarify the interpretation of estimated effects in a MVMR analysis under a range of underlying scenarios, where a secondary exposure acts variously as a confounder, a mediator, a pleiotropic pathway and a collider. We then describe how instrument strength and validity can be assessed for an MVMR analysis in the single-sample setting, and develop tests to assess these assumptions in the popular two-sample summary data setting. We illustrate our methods using data from UK Biobank to estimate the effect of education and cognitive ability on body mass index.MVMR analysis consistently estimates the direct causal effect of an exposure, or exposures, of interest and provides a powerful tool for determining causal effects in a wide range of scenarios with either individual- or summary-level data.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and insulin resistance (IR) in obesity defined by body mass index (BMI), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), or both combined. METHODS: Secondary analysis of a randomized multicenter trial of antioxidant supplementation versus placebo in nulliparous low-risk women to prevent pregnancy associated hypertension. Women between 9 and 16 weeks with data for WHR and BMI were analyzed for GDM (n = 2,300). Those with fasting glucose and insulin between 22 and 26 weeks (n = 717) were analyzed for IR by homeostatic model assessment of IR (normal, ≤ 75th percentile). WHR and BMI were categorized as normal (WHR, {\textless} 0.80; BMI, {\textless} 25 kg/m(2)); overweight (WHR, 0.8-0.84; BMI, 25-29.9 kg/m(2)); and obese (WHR, ≥ 0.85; BMI ≥ 30 kg/m(2)). Receiver operating characteristic curves and logistic regression models were used. RESULTS: Compared with normal, the risks of GDM or IR were higher in obese by BMI or WHR. The subgroup with obesity by WHR but not by BMI had no increased risk of GDM. BMI was a better predictor of IR (area under the curve [AUC]: 0.71 [BMI], 0.65 [WHR], p = 0.03) but similar to WHR for GDM (AUC: 0.68 [BMI], 0.63 [WHR], p = 0.18). CONCLUSION: Increased WHR and BMI in early pregnancy are associated with IR and GDM. BMI is a better predictor of IR compared with WHR. Adding WHR to BMI does not improve its ability to detect GDM or IR.},

Seven loci showed a larger effect on BF{\%} than on BMI, suggestive of a primary association with adiposity, while five loci showed larger effects on BMI than on BF{\%}, suggesting association with both fat and lean mass. In particular, the loci more strongly associated with BF{\%} showed distinct cross-phenotype association signatures with a range of cardiometabolic traits revealing new insights in the link between adiposity and disease risk.},

abstract = {Abstract Adipose tissue is a major endocrine organ, releasing signaling and mediator proteins, termed adipokines, via which adipose tissue communicates with other organs. Expansion of adipose tissue in obesity alters adipokine secretion which may contribute to the development of metabolic diseases. Consequently, this correlation has emphasized the importance to further characterize the adipocyte secretion profile, and several attempts have been made to characterize the complex nature of the adipose tissue secretome by utilizing diverse proteomic profiling approaches. Although the entirety of human adipokines is still incompletely characterized, to date more than 600 potentially secretory proteins were identified providing a rich source to identify putative novel biomarkers associated with metabolic diseases.},

abstract = {Background Evidence from high-income countries shows that higher adiposity results in an adverse lipid profile, but it is unclear whether this association is similar in Sub-Saharan African (SSA) populations. This study aimed to assess the association between total and central adiposity measures and lipid profile in Malawi, exploring differences by sex and area of residence (rural/urban).Methods In this cross-sectional study, data from 12 096 rural and 12 847 urban Malawian residents were used. The associations of body mass index (BMI) and waist to hip ratio (WHR) with fasting lipids (total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) and triglycerides (TG)) were assessed by area and sex.Results After adjusting for potential confounders, higher BMI and WHR were linearly associated with increased TC, LDL-C and TG and reduced HDL-C. BMI was more strongly related to fasting lipids than was WHR. The associations of adiposity with adverse lipid profile were stronger in rural compared with urban residents. For instance, one SD increase in BMI was associated with 0.23 mmol/L (95{\%} CI 0.19 to 0.26) increase in TC in rural women and 0.13 mmol/L (95{\%} CI 0.11 to 0.15) in urban women. Sex differences in the associations between adiposity and lipids were less evident.Conclusions The consistent associations observed of higher adiposity with adverse lipid profiles in men and women living in rural and urban areas of Malawi highlight the emerging adverse cardio-metabolic epidemic in this poor population. Our findings underline the potential utility of BMI in estimating cardiovascular risk and highlight the need for greater investment to understand the long-term health outcomes of obesity and adverse lipid profiles and the extent to which lifestyle changes and treatments effectively prevent and modify adverse cardio-metabolic outcomes.},

New methods, large-scale genome-wide analyses, molecular epigenetics and other new -omics technologies are all providing exceptional opportunities for the exploitation of Mendelian randomization approaches to understand causes of complex traits and disease outcomes. This research has the potential to identify new approaches for the prevention and treatment of common conditions.The origins of what is now termed ‘Mendelian randomization' (Figure 1, see caption for assumptions) can be traced back over half a century,1 although the first extended presentation of the principles was in this journal just over a decade ago,2 Since then it has become a widely utilized methodology, with publications covering many branches of biomarker,3–12 behavioural13–16 and infectious disease17,18 epidemiology. Mendelian randomization studies with clear implications for pharmacotherapeutics are also becoming commonplace,19–21 and applications to social science and to economics (the field in which the statistical technique of instrumental variables analysis central to Mendelian randomization was initially conceived22) are being developed.23,24},

abstract = {Genome-wide discovery efforts have identified more than 500 genetic loci associated with adiposity traits. The vast majority of these loci were found through large-scale meta-analyses for body mass index (BMI) and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), and in European ancestry populations. However, alternative approaches, focusing on non-European ancestry populations, more refined adiposity measures, and low-frequency (minor allele frequency (MAF){\textless}5{\%}) coding variants, identified additional novel loci that had not been identified before. Loci associated with overall obesity implicate pathways that act in the brain, whereas loci associated with fat distribution point to pathways involved in adipocyte biology. Pinpointing the causal gene within each locus remains challenging, but is a critical step towards translation of genome-wide association study (GWAS) loci into new biology. Ultimately, new genes may provide pharmacological targets for the development of weight loss drugs.},

abstract = {Abstract Objective Bone turnover, which regulates bone mass, may exert metabolic consequences, particularly on markers of glucose metabolism and adiposity. To better understand these relationships, we examined cross-sectional associations between bone turnover markers (BTMs) and metabolic traits in a population with high bone mass (HBM, BMD Z-score ≥+3.2). Design ?-C-terminal telopeptide of type-I collagen (?-CTX), procollagen type-1 amino-terminal propeptide (P1NP) and osteocalcin were assessed by electrochemiluminescence immunoassays. Metabolic traits, including lipids and glycolysis-related metabolites, were measured using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Associations of BTMs with metabolic traits were assessed using generalized estimating equation linear regression, accounting for within-family correlation, adjusting for potential confounders (age, sex, height, weight, menopause, bisphosphonate and oral glucocorticoid use). Results A total of 198 adults with HBM had complete data, mean [SD] age 61.6 [13.7] years; 77{\%} were female. Of 23 summary metabolic traits, citrate was positively related to all BTMs: adjusted ??-CTX = 0.050 (95{\%} CI 0.024, 0.076), P = 1.71 ? 10?4, ?osteocalcin = 6.54 ? 10?4 (1.87 ? 10?4, 0.001), P = .006 and ?P1NP = 2.40 ? 10?4 (6.49 ? 10?5, 4.14 ? 10?4), P = .007 (? = increase in citrate (mmol/L) per 1 µg/L BTM increase). Inverse relationships of ?-CTX (? = ?0.276 [?0.434, ?0.118], P = 6.03 ? 10?4) and osteocalcin (?0.004 [?0.007, ?0.001], P = .020) with triglycerides were also identified. We explored the generalizability of these associations in 3664 perimenopausal women (age 47.9 [4.4] years) from a UK family cohort. We confirmed a positive, albeit lower magnitude, association between ?-CTX and citrate (adjusted ?women = 0.020 [0.013, 0.026], P = 1.95 ? 10?9) and an inverse association of similar magnitude between ?-CTX and triglycerides (? = ?0.354 [?0.471, ?0.237], P = 3.03 ? 10?9). Conclusions Bone resorption is positively related to circulating citrate and inversely related to triglycerides. Further studies are justified to determine whether plasma citrate or triglyceride concentrations are altered by factors known to modulate bone resorption, such as bisphosphonates.},

Methods We did a systematic search using PubMed and Scopus, from inception up to January 2017. Prospective cohort studies reporting the risk estimates of hypertension for three or more quantitative categories of indices of general and abdominal adiposity were included. Summary relative risks were calculated using random-effects models. Results Fifty-seven prospective cohort studies were included. Summary relative risks were 1.49 (95{\%} confidence interval [CI]: 1.41, 1.58; I2 = 97.4{\%}, n = 50) for a five-unit increment in body mass index, 1.27 (95{\%}CI: 1.15, 1.39; I2 = 95.0{\%}, n = 14) for a 10-cm increment in waist circumference, 1.16 (95{\%}CI: 1.09, 1.23; I2 = 77.8{\%}, n = 5) for weight gain equal to a one-unit increment in BMI, and 1.37 (95{\%}CI: 1.24, 1.51; I2 = 76.4{\%}, n = 8) and 1.74 (95{\%}CI: 1.35, 2.13; I2 = 58.9{\%}, n = 4) for a 0.1-unit increment in waist-to-hip ratio and waist-to-height ratio, respectively. The risk of hypertension increased continuously with increasing all anthropometric measures, and also along with weight gain. Conclusion Being as lean as possible within the normal body mass index range may be the best suggestion in relation to primary prevention of hypertension.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In 2010, overweight and obesity were estimated to cause 3{\textperiodcentered}4 million deaths, 3{\textperiodcentered}9{\%} of years of life lost, and 3{\textperiodcentered}8{\%} of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) worldwide. The rise in obesity has led to widespread calls for regular monitoring of changes in overweight and obesity prevalence in all populations. Comparable, up-to-date information about levels and trends is essential to quantify population health effects and to prompt decision makers to prioritise action. We estimate the global, regional, and national prevalence of overweight and obesity in children and adults during 1980-2013. METHODS: We systematically identified surveys, reports, and published studies (n=1769) that included data for height and weight, both through physical measurements and self-reports. We used mixed effects linear regression to correct for bias in self-reports. We obtained data for prevalence of obesity and overweight by age, sex, country, and year (n=19,244) with a spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression model to estimate prevalence with 95{\%} uncertainty intervals (UIs). FINDINGS: Worldwide, the proportion of adults with a body-mass index (BMI) of 25 kg/m(2) or greater increased between 1980 and 2013 from 28{\textperiodcentered}8{\%} (95{\%} UI 28{\textperiodcentered}4-29{\textperiodcentered}3) to 36{\textperiodcentered}9{\%} (36{\textperiodcentered}3-37{\textperiodcentered}4) in men, and from 29{\textperiodcentered}8{\%} (29{\textperiodcentered}3-30{\textperiodcentered}2) to 38{\textperiodcentered}0{\%} (37{\textperiodcentered}5-38{\textperiodcentered}5) in women. Prevalence has increased substantially in children and adolescents in developed countries; 23{\textperiodcentered}8{\%} (22{\textperiodcentered}9-24{\textperiodcentered}7) of boys and 22{\textperiodcentered}6{\%} (21{\textperiodcentered}7-23{\textperiodcentered}6) of girls were overweight or obese in 2013. The prevalence of overweight and obesity has also increased in children and adolescents in developing countries, from 8{\textperiodcentered}1{\%} (7{\textperiodcentered}7-8{\textperiodcentered}6) to 12{\textperiodcentered}9{\%} (12{\textperiodcentered}3-13{\textperiodcentered}5) in 2013 for boys and from 8{\textperiodcentered}4{\%} (8{\textperiodcentered}1-8{\textperiodcentered}8) to 13{\textperiodcentered}4{\%} (13{\textperiodcentered}0-13{\textperiodcentered}9) in girls. In adults, estimated prevalence of obesity exceeded 50{\%} in men in Tonga and in women in Kuwait, Kiribati, Federated States of Micronesia, Libya, Qatar, Tonga, and Samoa. Since 2006, the increase in adult obesity in developed countries has slowed down. INTERPRETATION: Because of the established health risks and substantial increases in prevalence, obesity has become a major global health challenge. Not only is obesity increasing, but no national success stories have been reported in the past 33 years. Urgent global action and leadership is needed to help countries to more effectively intervene.

When compared with the low BF group, the prevalence of metabolic syndrome in subjects with NWO was four-fold higher (16.6 vs. 4.8{\%}, P {\textless} 0.0001). Subjects with NWO also had higher prevalence of dyslipidaemia, hypertension (men), and CV disease (women). After adjustment, women with NWO showed a significant 2.2-fold increased risk for CV mortality (HR = 2.2; 95{\%} CI, 1.03-4.67) in comparison to the low BF group. CONCLUSION: Normal weight obesity, defined as the combination of normal BMI and high BF content, is associated with a high prevalence of cardiometabolic dysregulation, metabolic syndrome, and CV risk factors. In women, NWO is independently associated with increased risk for CV mortality.},

abstract = {The worldwide epidemic of obesity and type 2 diabetes has greatly increased interest in the biology and physiology of adipose tissues. Adipose (fat) cells are specialized for the storage of energy in the form of triglycerides, but research in the last few decades has shown that fat cells also play a critical role in sensing and responding to changes in systemic energy balance. White fat cells secrete important hormone-like molecules such as leptin, adiponectin, and adipsin to influence processes such as food intake, insulin sensitivity, and insulin secretion. Brown fat, on the other hand, dissipates chemical energy in the form of heat, thereby defending against hypothermia, obesity, and diabetes. It is now appreciated that there are two distinct types of thermogenic fat cells, termed brown and beige adipocytes. In addition to these distinct properties of fat cells, adipocytes exist within adipose tissue, where they are in dynamic communication with immune cells and closely influenced by innervation and blood supply. This review is intended to serve as an introduction to adipose cell biology and to familiarize the reader with how these cell types play a role in metabolic disease and, perhaps, as targets for therapeutic development.},

abstract = {Mendelian randomization (MR) provides us the opportunity to investigate the causal paths of metabolites in type 2 diabetes and glucose homeostasis. We developed and tested an MR approach based on genetic risk scoring for plasma metabolite levels, utilizing a pathway-based sensitivity analysis to control for nonspecific effects. We focused on 124 circulating metabolites that correlate with fasting glucose in the Erasmus Rucphen Family (ERF) study (n = 2,564) and tested the possible causal effect of each metabolite with glucose and type 2 diabetes and vice versa. We detected 14 paths with potential causal effects by MR, following pathway-based sensitivity analysis. Our results suggest that elevated plasma triglycerides might be partially responsible for increased glucose levels and type 2 diabetes risk, which is consistent with previous reports. Additionally, elevated HDL components, i.e., small HDL triglycerides, might have a causal role of elevating glucose levels. In contrast, large (L) and extra large (XL) HDL lipid components, i.e., XL-HDL cholesterol, XL-HDL–free cholesterol, XL-HDL phospholipids, L-HDL cholesterol, and L-HDL–free cholesterol, as well as HDL cholesterol seem to be protective against increasing fasting glucose but not against type 2 diabetes. Finally, we demonstrate that genetic predisposition to type 2 diabetes associates with increased levels of alanine and decreased levels of phosphatidylcholine alkyl-acyl C42:5 and phosphatidylcholine alkyl-acyl C44:4. Our MR results provide novel insight into promising causal paths to and from glucose and type 2 diabetes and underline the value of additional information from high-resolution metabolomics over classic biochemistry.},

We conduct an extended genome-wide association study of genetic influences on 123 circulating metabolic traits quantified by nuclear magnetic resonance metabolomics from up to 24,925 individuals and identify eight novel loci for amino acids, pyruvate and fatty acids. The LPA locus link with cardiovascular risk exemplifies how detailed metabolic profiling may inform underlying aetiology via extensive associations with very-low-density lipoprotein and triglyceride metabolism. Genetic fine mapping and Mendelian randomization uncover wide-spread causal effects of lipoprotein(a) on overall lipoprotein metabolism and we assess potential pleiotropic consequences of genetically elevated lipoprotein(a) on diverse morbidities via electronic health-care records.

abstract = {Mendelian randomization (MR) is a method for estimating the causal relationship between an exposure and an outcome using a genetic factor as an instrumental variable (IV) for the exposure. In the traditional MR setting, data on the IV, exposure, and outcome are available for all participants. However, obtaining complete exposure data may be difficult in some settings, due to high measurement costs or lack of appropriate biospecimens. We used simulated data sets to assess statistical power and bias for MR when exposure data are available for a subset (or an independent set) of participants. We show that obtaining exposure data for a subset of participants is a cost-efficient strategy, often having negligible effects on power in comparison with a traditional complete-data analysis. The size of the subset needed to achieve maximum power depends on IV strength, and maximum power is approximately equal to the power of traditional IV estimators. Weak IVs are shown to lead to bias towards the null when the subsample is small and towards the confounded association when the subset is relatively large. Various approaches for confidence interval calculation are considered. These results have important implications for reducing the costs and increasing the feasibility of MR studies.},

We used data from a United Kingdom (UK) cohort to compare metabolic profiles and associations of maternal age, education, parity, height, BMI, tricep skinfold thickness, gestational diabetes (GD), pre-eclampsia, and gestational hypertension with 156 metabolic measurements in WE (n = 4072) and SA (n = 4702) women. Metabolic profiles, measured in fasting serum taken between 26-28 weeks gestation, were quantified by nuclear magnetic resonance. Distributions of most metabolic measures differed by ethnicity. WE women had higher levels of most lipoprotein subclasses, cholesterol, glycerides and phospholipids, monosaturated fatty acids, and creatinine but lower levels of glucose, linoleic acid, omega-6 and polyunsaturated fatty acids, and most amino acids. Higher BMI and having GD were associated with higher levels of several lipoprotein subclasses, triglycerides, and other metabolites, mostly with stronger associations in WEs. We have shown differences in gestational metabolic profiles between WE and SA women and demonstrated that associations of exposures with these metabolites differ by ethnicity.},

abstract = {Background Assessing the relationship between lung cancer and metabolic conditions is challenging because of the confounding effect of tobacco. Mendelian randomization (MR), or the use of genetic instrumental variables to assess causality, may help to identify the metabolic drivers of lung cancer.   Methods and findings We identified genetic instruments for potential metabolic risk factors and evaluated these in relation to risk using 29,266 lung cancer cases (including 11,273 adenocarcinomas, 7,426 squamous cell and 2,664 small cell cases) and 56,450 controls. The MR risk analysis suggested a causal effect of body mass index (BMI) on lung cancer risk for two of the three major histological subtypes, with evidence of a risk increase for squamous cell carcinoma (odds ratio (OR) [95{\%} confidence interval (CI)] = 1.20 [1.01–1.43] and for small cell lung cancer (OR [95{\%}CI] = 1.52 [1.15–2.00]) for each standard deviation (SD) increase in BMI [4.6 kg/m2]), but not for adenocarcinoma (OR [95{\%}CI] = 0.93 [0.79–1.08]) (Pheterogeneity = 4.3x10-3). Additional analysis using a genetic instrument for BMI showed that each SD increase in BMI increased cigarette consumption by 1.27 cigarettes per day (P = 2.1x10-3), providing novel evidence that a genetic susceptibility to obesity influences smoking patterns. There was also evidence that low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was inversely associated with lung cancer overall risk (OR [95{\%}CI] = 0.90 [0.84–0.97] per SD of 38 mg/dl), while fasting insulin was positively associated (OR [95{\%}CI] = 1.63 [1.25–2.13] per SD of 44.4 pmol/l). Sensitivity analyses including a weighted-median approach and MR-Egger test did not detect other pleiotropic effects biasing the main results.   Conclusions Our results are consistent with a causal role of fasting insulin and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in lung cancer etiology, as well as for BMI in squamous cell and small cell carcinoma. The latter relation may be mediated by a previously unrecognized effect of obesity on smoking behavior.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Although obesity is recognized as an important risk of mortality, how the amount and distribution of body fat affect mortality risk is unclear. Furthermore, whether fat distribution confers any additional risk of mortality in addition to fat amount is not understood. METHODS: This data linkage cohort study included 16415 participants (8554 females) aged 18 to 89 years from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III (1988-1994) and its linked mortality data (31 December 2011). Cox proportional hazard models and parametric survival models were used to estimate the association between body fat percentage (BF{\%}), based on bioelectrical impedance analysis, and waist-hip ratio (WHR) with mortality. RESULTS: A total of 4999 deaths occurred during 19-year follow-up. A U-shaped association between BF{\%} and mortality was found in both sexes, with the adjusted hazard ratios for other groups between 1.02 (95{\%} confidence interval: 0.89, 1.18) and 2.10 (1.47, 3.01) when BF{\%} groups of 25-30{\%} in males and 30-35{\%} in females were used as references. A non-linear relationship between WHR and mortality was detected in males, with the adjusted hazard ratios among other groups ranging from 1.05 (0.94, 1.18) to 1.52 (1.15, 2.00) compared with the WHR category of 0.95-1.0. However in females, the death risk constantly increased across the WHR spectrum. Joint impact of BF{\%} and WHR suggested males with BF{\%} of 25-30{\%} and WHR of 0.95-1.0 and females with BF{\%} of 30-35{\%} and WHR {\textless}0.9 were associated with the lowest mortality risk and longest survival age compared with their counterparts in other categories. CONCLUSIONS: This study supported the use of body fat distribution in addition to fat amount in assessing the risk of all-cause mortality.},

abstract = {Adiponectin is the most abundant peptide secreted by adipocytes, whose reduction plays a central role in obesity-related diseases, including insulin resistance/type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. In addition to adipocytes, other cell types, such as skeletal and cardiac myocytes and endothelial cells, can also produce this adipocytokine. Adiponectin effects are mediated by adiponectin receptors, which occur as two isoforms (AdipoR1 and AdipoR2). Adiponectin has direct actions in liver, skeletal muscle, and the vasculature.Adiponectin exists in the circulation as varying molecular weight forms, produced by multimerization. Several endoplasmic reticulum ER-associated proteins, including ER oxidoreductase 1-$\alpha$ (Ero1-$\alpha$), ER resident protein 44 (ERp44), disulfide-bond A oxidoreductase-like protein (DsbA-L), and glucose-regulated protein 94 (GPR94), have recently been found to be involved in the assembly and secretion of higher-order adiponectin complexes. Recent data indicate that the high-molecular weight (HMW) complexes have the predominant action in metabolic tissues. Studies have shown that adiponectin administration in humans and rodents has insulin-sensitizing, anti-atherogenic, and anti-inflammatory effects, and, in certain settings, also decreases body weight. Therefore, adiponectin replacement therapy in humans may suggest potential versatile therapeutic targets in the treatment of obesity, insulin resistance/type 2 diabetes, and atherosclerosis. The current knowledge on regulation and function of adiponectin in obesity, insulin resistance, and cardiovascular disease is summarized in this review.},

All participants were free of clinical CVD at baseline with available BMI index and CVD outcomes data. Data were analyzed from October 2016 to July 2017.World Health Organization–standardized BMI categories.Total CVD and CVD subtype, including fatal and nonfatal coronary heart disease, stroke, congestive heart failure, and other CVD deaths. Heights and weights were measured directly by investigators in each study, and BMI was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared. We performed (1) modified Kaplan-Meier analysis to estimate lifetime risks, (2) adjusted competing Cox models to estimate joint cumulative risks for CVD or noncardiovascular death, and (3) the Irwin restricted mean to estimate years lived free of and with CVD.Of the 190 672 in-person examinations included in this study, the mean (SD) age was 46.0 (15.0) years for men and 58.7 (12.9) years for women, and 140 835 patients (73.9{\%}) were female. Compared with individuals with a normal BMI (defined as a BMI of 18.5 to 24.9), lifetime risks for incident CVD were higher in middle-aged adults in the overweight and obese groups. Compared with normal weight, among middle-aged men and women, competing hazard ratios for incident CVD were 1.21 (95{\%} CI, 1.14-1.28) and 1.32 (95{\%} CI, 1.24-1.40), respectively, for overweight (BMI, 25.0-29.9), 1.67 (95{\%} CI, 1.55-1.79) and 1.85 (95{\%} CI, 1.72-1.99) for obesity (BMI, 30.0-39.9), and 3.14 (95{\%} CI, 2.48-3.97) and 2.53 (95{\%} CI, 2.20-2.91) for morbid obesity (BMI, ≥40.0). Higher BMI had the strongest association with incident heart failure among CVD subtypes. Average years lived with CVD were longer for middle-aged adults in the overweight and obese groups compared with adults in the normal BMI group. Similar patterns were observed in younger and older adults.In this study, obesity was associated with shorter longevity and significantly increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality compared with normal BMI. Despite similar longevity compared with normal BMI, overweight was associated with significantly increased risk of developing CVD at an earlier age, resulting in a greater proportion of life lived with CVD morbidity.},

Here we combine summary statistics from those two studies with GWAS of height and BMI performed in ∼450000 UK Biobank participants of European ancestry. Overall, our combined GWAS meta-analysis reaches N ∼700000 individuals and substantially increases the number of GWAS signals associated with these traits. We identified 3290 and 941 near-independent SNPs associated with height and BMI, respectively (at a revised genome-wide significance threshold of P {\textless} 1 × 10-8), including 1185 height-associated SNPs and 751 BMI-associated SNPs located within loci not previously identified by these two GWAS. The near-independent genome-wide significant SNPs explain ∼24.6{\%} of the variance of height and ∼6.0{\%} of the variance of BMI in an independent sample from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). Correlations between polygenic scores based upon these SNPs with actual height and BMI in HRS participants were ∼0.44 and ∼0.22, respectively. From analyses of integrating GWAS and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) data by summary-data-based Mendelian randomization, we identified an enrichment of eQTLs among lead height and BMI signals, prioritizing 610 and 138 genes, respectively. Our study demonstrates that, as previously predicted, increasing GWAS sample sizes continues to deliver, by the discovery of new loci, increasing prediction accuracy and providing additional data to achieve deeper insight into complex trait biology. All summary statistics are made available for follow-up studies.},

abstract = {The Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) is a transgenerational prospective observational study investigating influences on health and development across the life course. It considers multiple genetic, epigenetic, biological, psychological, social and other environmental exposures in relation to a similarly diverse range of health, social and developmental outcomes. Recruitment sought to enroll pregnant women in the Bristol area of the UK during 1990-92; this was extended to include additional children eligible using the original enrollment definition up to the age of 18 years. The children from 14541 pregnancies were recruited in 1990-92, increasing to 15247 pregnancies by the age of 18 years. This cohort profile describes the index children of these pregnancies. Follow-up includes 59 questionnaires (4 weeks-18 years of age) and 9 clinical assessment visits (7-17 years of age). The resource comprises a wide range of phenotypic and environmental measures in addition to biological samples, genetic (DNA on 11343 children, genome-wide data on 8365 children, complete genome sequencing on 2000 children) and epigenetic (methylation sampling on 1000 children) information and linkage to health and administrative records. Data access is described in this article and is currently set up as a supported access resource. To date, over 700 peer-reviewed articles have been published using ALSPAC data.},

abstract = {Summary Background The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2017 comparative risk assessment (CRA) is a comprehensive approach to risk factor quantification that offers a useful tool for synthesising evidence on risks and risk–outcome associations. With each annual GBD study, we update the GBD CRA to incorporate improved methods, new risks and risk–outcome pairs, and new data on risk exposure levels and risk–outcome associations. Methods We used the CRA framework developed for previous iterations of GBD to estimate levels and trends in exposure, attributable deaths, and attributable disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), by age group, sex, year, and location for 84 behavioural, environmental and occupational, and metabolic risks or groups of risks from 1990 to 2017. This study included 476 risk–outcome pairs that met the GBD study criteria for convincing or probable evidence of causation. We extracted relative risk and exposure estimates from 46 749 randomised controlled trials, cohort studies, household surveys, census data, satellite data, and other sources. We used statistical models to pool data, adjust for bias, and incorporate covariates. Using the counterfactual scenario of theoretical minimum risk exposure level (TMREL), we estimated the portion of deaths and DALYs that could be attributed to a given risk. We explored the relationship between development and risk exposure by modelling the relationship between the Socio-demographic Index (SDI) and risk-weighted exposure prevalence and estimated expected levels of exposure and risk-attributable burden by SDI. Finally, we explored temporal changes in risk-attributable DALYs by decomposing those changes into six main component drivers of change as follows: (1) population growth; (2) changes in population age structures; (3) changes in exposure to environmental and occupational risks; (4) changes in exposure to behavioural risks; (5) changes in exposure to metabolic risks; and (6) changes due to all other factors, approximated as the risk-deleted death and DALY rates, where the risk-deleted rate is the rate that would be observed had we reduced the exposure levels to the TMREL for all risk factors included in GBD 2017. Findings In 2017, 34{\textperiodcentered}1 million (95{\%} uncertainty interval [UI] 33{\textperiodcentered}3–35{\textperiodcentered}0) deaths and 1{\textperiodcentered}21 billion (1{\textperiodcentered}14–1{\textperiodcentered}28) DALYs were attributable to GBD risk factors. Globally, 61{\textperiodcentered}0{\%} (59{\textperiodcentered}6–62{\textperiodcentered}4) of deaths and 48{\textperiodcentered}3{\%} (46{\textperiodcentered}3–50{\textperiodcentered}2) of DALYs were attributed to the GBD 2017 risk factors. When ranked by risk-attributable DALYs, high systolic blood pressure (SBP) was the leading risk factor, accounting for 10{\textperiodcentered}4 million (9{\textperiodcentered}39–11{\textperiodcentered}5) deaths and 218 million (198–237) DALYs, followed by smoking (7{\textperiodcentered}10 million [6{\textperiodcentered}83–7{\textperiodcentered}37] deaths and 182 million [173–193] DALYs), high fasting plasma glucose (6{\textperiodcentered}53 million [5{\textperiodcentered}23–8{\textperiodcentered}23] deaths and 171 million [144–201] DALYs), high body-mass index (BMI; 4{\textperiodcentered}72 million [2{\textperiodcentered}99–6{\textperiodcentered}70] deaths and 148 million [98{\textperiodcentered}6–202] DALYs), and short gestation for birthweight (1{\textperiodcentered}43 million [1{\textperiodcentered}36–1{\textperiodcentered}51] deaths and 139 million [131–147] DALYs). In total, risk-attributable DALYs declined by 4{\textperiodcentered}9{\%} (3{\textperiodcentered}3–6{\textperiodcentered}5) between 2007 and 2017. In the absence of demographic changes (ie, population growth and ageing), changes in risk exposure and risk-deleted DALYs would have led to a 23{\textperiodcentered}5{\%} decline in DALYs during that period. Conversely, in the absence of changes in risk exposure and risk-deleted DALYs, demographic changes would have led to an 18{\textperiodcentered}6{\%} increase in DALYs during that period. The ratios of observed risk exposure levels to exposure levels expected based on SDI (O/E ratios) increased globally for unsafe drinking water and household air pollution between 1990 and 2017. This result suggests that development is occurring more rapidly than are changes in the underlying risk structure in a population. Conversely, nearly universal declines in O/E ratios for smoking and alcohol use indicate that, for a given SDI, exposure to these risks is declining. In 2017, the leading Level 4 risk factor for age-standardised DALY rates was high SBP in four super-regions: central Europe, eastern Europe, and central Asia; north Africa and Middle East; south Asia; and southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania. The leading risk factor in the high-income super-region was smoking, in Latin America and Caribbean was high BMI, and in sub-Saharan Africa was unsafe sex. O/E ratios for unsafe sex in sub-Saharan Africa were notably high, and those for alcohol use in north Africa and the Middle East were notably low. Interpretation By quantifying levels and trends in exposures to risk factors and the resulting disease burden, this assessment offers insight into where past policy and programme efforts might have been successful and highlights current priorities for public health action. Decreases in behavioural, environmental, and occupational risks have largely offset the effects of population growth and ageing, in relation to trends in absolute burden. Conversely, the combination of increasing metabolic risks and population ageing will probably continue to drive the increasing trends in non-communicable diseases at the global level, which presents both a public health challenge and opportunity. We see considerable spatiotemporal heterogeneity in levels of risk exposure and risk-attributable burden. Although levels of development underlie some of this heterogeneity, O/E ratios show risks for which countries are overperforming or underperforming relative to their level of development. As such, these ratios provide a benchmarking tool to help to focus local decision making. Our findings reinforce the importance of both risk exposure monitoring and epidemiological research to assess causal connections between risks and health outcomes, and they highlight the usefulness of the GBD study in synthesising data to draw comprehensive and robust conclusions that help to inform good policy and strategic health planning.

abstract = {As the conduit for nutrients and growth signals, the placenta is critical to establishing an environment sufficient for fetal growth and development. To better understand the mechanisms regulating placental development and gene expression, we characterized the transcriptome of term placenta from 20 healthy women with uncomplicated pregnancies using RNA-seq. To identify genes that were highly expressed and unique to the placenta we compared placental RNA-seq data to data from 7 other tissues (adipose, breast, hear, kidney, liver, lung, and smooth muscle) and identified several genes novel to placental biology (QSOX1, DLG5, and SEMA7A). Semi-quantitative RT-PCR confirmed the RNA-seq results and immunohistochemistry indicated these proteins were highly expressed in the placental syncytium. Additionally, we mined our RNA-seq data to map the relative expression of key developmental gene families (Fox, Sox, Gata, Tead, and Wnt) within the placenta. We identified FOXO4, GATA3, and WNT7A to be amongst the highest expressed members of these families. Overall, these findings provide a new reference for understanding of placental transcriptome and can aid in the identification of novel pathways regulating placenta physiology that may be dysregulated in placental disease.},
