### Abstract

Increased adipose tissue, adiposity, is associated with many diseases
and overall mortality. This thesis aimed to identify whether metabolites
are intermediates in these associations using a variety of resources and
methods to strengthen causal inference. <br>

In a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis (Chapter
@ref(systematic-review)), the causal effects of adiposity were observed
across a broad spectrum of diseases, including endometrial cancer which
was selected for subsequent analysis. These results were supported by a
narrative synthesis of over 2,000 MR analyses, which also highlighted
evidence of an association between adiposity and many, predominantly
lipid, metabolites. <br>

Within the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC),
evidence for a consistent effect of body mass index (BMI), waist hip
ratio (WHR), and body fat percentage (BF) on up-to 230, predominantly
lipid, metabolites was found (Chapter @ref(observational)). In these
linear models, the effect of adiposity persisted after adjustment for
covariates and across multiple time points (\~9, \~18, \~24, \~50 years
old). <br>

In two independent datasets, Mendelian randomization (MR), which can
overcome limitations in observational analyses, provided further
evidence for an effect of BMI and WHR on up-to 230, predominantly lipid,
metabolites (Chapter @ref(MR)). These effects were consistent in
sensitivity analyses. The effect of BF on metabolites was, unlike in
observational analyses, broadly opposite to the effects of BMI and WHR.
<br>

Evidence from observational and MR analyses identified 56
adiposity-associated metabolites. Two of these (triglycerides in small
and very small VLDL) were associated with endometrial cancer in MR
analysis and selected for intermediate analysis (Chapter
@ref(mediation)). When comparing multivariable and univariable MR
estimates, there was evidence for a potential intermediary role of both
metabolites on the effect of WHR and BF, but not BMI, on
non-endometrioid cancer. Weak instruments may have biased these results
however. <br>

### How

Thesis written in `R Markdown` using
[bristolthesis](https://github.com/mattlee821/bristolthesis), an altered
version of [thesisdown](https://github.com/ismayc/thesisdown) that
complies with the University of Bristolâ€™s regulations. All formatting is
controlled by
[`template.tex`](https://github.com/mattlee821/000_thesis/blob/master/index/template.tex)
and
[`bristolthesis.cls`](https://github.com/mattlee821/000_thesis/blob/master/index/bristolthesis.cls).
The
[`_bookdown.yml`](https://github.com/mattlee821/000_thesis/blob/master/index/_bookdown.yml)
file is used to compile the individual `.Rmd` files alongside
[`index.Rmd`](https://github.com/mattlee821/000_thesis/blob/master/index/index.Rmd).
