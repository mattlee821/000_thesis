### *Increased adiposity and associations with disease* {-}

This chapter provides the context of the thesis. It briefly gives the background on the problem of increased adiposity, the biology of adipose tissue, and diseases linking increased body mass index and mortality. The chapter briefly explores different measures of increased adiposity and potential hypotheses for underlying aetiology of diseases associated with increased adiposity. Finally, the potential application of metabolites and Mendelian randomization in the context of understanding underlying aetiology are discussed. <br>

## Background {#background}

Globally, the prevalence of overweight (body mass index (BMI) of 25--29.9 kg/m^2^) and obesity (BMI > 30 kg/m^2^) is 39% and 13% respectively[@WorldHealthOrganisation2018](Figure \@ref(fig:overweight-graph) and \@ref(fig:obesity-graph)). Obesity is estimated to be responsible for 8% of global deaths[@Stanaway2018] and this number is likely to rise as the prevalence of obesity increases[@Ng2014; @NCD-RisC2016; @Abarca-Gomez2017]. <br>

Body mass index is a measure of weight given an adjustment of height and thus an approximation of body composition. Given its simplicity, BMI is the most commonly used measure of increased adiposity. Body mass index can be classified into sub-types according to the range of values seen in the general population. Whilst ethnicity, sex, and age specific, the international standards set by the WHO[@WHO1995; @WHO2000] estimate a normal weight classification at a population level to be a BMI of 18.5--24.9 kg/m^2^, with an underweight class below this. Underweight is a specific condition that may be secondary to or symptomatic of an underlying disease and is not within the scope of this thesis. <br>

## Additional measures of increased adiposity {#additional-measures}
<!--- --->
Though a simple and effective measure of increased adiposity, BMI does not have the resolution to accurately measure body composition[@Pischon2008; @Romero-Corral2008; @Okorodudu2010; @Pasco2012]. This fact was discussed when first proposed and is particualrly evident in athletic and tall individuals[@Prentice2001]. 

There are also questions around the relationship with morbidity and mortality[@Flegal2013; @Lee2015; @Elagizi2018]. Though these questions are likely a result of confounding and other biases[@Banack2013; @Willett2013; @Khan2018], evidence has pointed to a more important role for fat deposition in the relationship with mortality[@Sahakyan2015; @Hamer2017]. <!---intermediate measures of health and what are the major issues here --->


Complimentary assessment of increased adiposity, using a combination of body composition measures, may provide additional information into the associations with disease[@WorldHealthOrganisation2008; @Collaboration2009]. Alongside BMI, waist hip ratio (WHR) is frequently used to gain a better understanding of fat deposition. A WHR > 0.85 in in women and > 0.9 in men is considered equivalent to a BMI of > 30$kg/m^2$[@WHO2008]. However, given that ultimately it is excess adipose accumulation that is responsible for disease development, direct assessment of body fat has been argued as key in understanding disease development[@Prentice2001]. Body fat percent (BF) provides an easily comparabile measure of excess adispose tissue. <br>

Both WHR and BF are used clinically and for population-based research to provide more alternative measures of an individuals body composition. Whereas BMI provides an overall approximation of an individuals proportions, WHR provides an approximate assessment of the deposition of fat around the body; deposition of fat at the waist is indicative of greater visceral fat[@WorldHealthOrganisation2008]. BF by its nature of measuring fat mass directly rather than estimating it like BMI, provides a more accurate estimation of body composition[@WorldHealthOrganisation2000]. Both BMI and WHR have a single measurement while BF can be measured in a a number of different ways including estimations based on WHR and BMI. Imaging measures, such as dual-emission X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), enable direct measurement of adipose tissue and are the most accurate measure of BF though are not practical at scale. <br>

As with BMI there are a number of considerations when using WHR and BF. Firstly, sexual dimoprhism is acutely present with both measures. Physiologically, women generally have more body fat than men for any given weight and/or height. This difference is observed after puberty. Fat deposition in women is predominantly around the hips while in men it is around the waist. This difference is refelected in their respective WHRs and is reason for the different threshold for obesity classification. <br>

With both WHR and BF there is potential for measurement error. There are specific guidelines produced by the WHO for taking waist and hip circumference measurements[@WHO2008] and it is estimated that error can be as high as 1.56$cm$[@WHO2008]. Measurement error for BF is dependent on the method used. For all methods the fasted status of the individual and whether they had recently performed exercise can influence measurement. Impedance devices aim to measure resistance of an electric current passed through an individual, with resistance, age, height, weight, and sex used in proprietary equations. As these equations are commercially sensitive their application to different populations is difficult to appraise. However, studies have shown similar results with more accurate measures of BF[@Jebb2000; @Chouinard2007]. Though imaging studies are able to directly measure fat-free and fat mass, a hard call must still be made as to whether the measured area is coded as fat-free or fat mass. That being said, there is high interindividual reproducibility of DXA measures[@Tallroth2013]. <br>

<!--- sample size and power --->


Like BMI[@Flegal2013; @Lee2015; @Elagizi2018], WHR[@Jenkins2018; @Pischon2008; @Rost2018; @Mørkedal2011; @Dong2018] and BF[@Jenkins2018; @Dong2018; @Lee2018; @Bigaard2004] are also associated with mortality. Performing a manual literature search for WHR and the categories identified in the MELODI analysis (Table \@ref(tab:chapter1-table-MELODI)) reveals a number of associations including: cancer[@Barberio2019], cardiovascular[@Dobbelsteyn2001; @Yusuf2005], kidney[@Elsayed2008], liver[@Sahlman2020], neurological/behavioural[@Wiltink2013; @Dye2017], pregnancy[@Basraon2016], respiratory[@Price2006a] and diabetes[@Qiao2010]. For BF, fewer studies were reported in the literature with associations including: cancer[@Lee2018], cardiovascular[@Romero-Corral2010; @Lee2018], kidney[@Oh2014], respiratory[@Lee2018], and diabetes[@Jo2018]. <!--- expand here and leave by saying that causality is a problem here and there are inconsistencies(if there are any) in the literature, hence where yoru thesis comes in ---> <br>


## Adipose tissue {#adipose-tissue}
Weight is made up of two components, fat free mass and fat mass. Fat free mass encompasses muscle, bone and water mass. Fat mass is an all encompassing term for adipose tissue. Adipose tissue is predominantly made up of adipocytes, with other tissues and cells such as the stromal vascular fraction, preadipocytes and fibroblasts making up smaller proportions[@Frayn2003; @Cohen2016; @Luo2016]. The main function of adipose tissue is energy storage in the form of lipids, with a secondary function to insulate the body and maintain thermoregulation. These two functions can broadly be separated into two types of adipose tissue, white and brown[@Cohen2016]. <br>

In addition to energy storage and insulation, adipose tissue is considered an endocrine organ, responsive to afferent signalling as well as being a prolific signaller itself[@Kershaw2004]. Advances in genetics and availability of large population studies has enabled the identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and genes associated with increased adipose tissue[@Dahlman2010]. <br>

### Energy storage 
<!--- This section is interesting and well-formed but, as Laura said, maybe too large and could even be incorporated into the metabolites section but keep for now and we’ll see how it flows at the end. --->
Energy storage is determined by energy intake and energy expenditure. An increase or decrease in one leads to a change in energy balance and thus an increase or decrease in total energy storage as $Energy\ balance = energy\ in - energy\ out$. Energy stores are comprised primarily of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats. For protein, there is little change in total energy stores outside of a growth stimulus (i.e. exercise is needed to increase protein stores)[@Galgani2008]. Carbohydrate stores fluctuate markedly throughout the day as a result of limited storage capacity and the fact that they comprise the majority of energy production[@Galgani2008]. Fats are the largest energy store. Daily fat intake is ~1% of the total available fat store[@Galgani2008]. Given the tight controls over protein and limited availability of carbohydrate storage, fat storage is the only expandable reservoir of excess energy intake[@Frayn2003; @Galgani2008]. As a result, an energy imbalance will be reflected in the fat stores and not elsewhere[@Frayn2003; @Galgani2008]. <br>

Excess energy is stored in adipocytes in the form of lipid droplets (triglycerides; Figure \@ref(fig:adipocyte)) via lipogenesis. The release of these fat stores, in the form of fatty acids, occurs through lipolysis. As the main store of excess energy, triglycerides provide an accurate reflection of energy imbalance, while adipocytes reflect the deposition and mobilisation of triglycerides[@Frayn2003]. Deposition and mobilisation of triglycerides, depicted in Figure \@ref(fig:adipocyte), is a product of a complex interplay of genetic and hormonal signals with leptin and insulin playing key roles[@Amitani2013]. Insulin stimulates the conversion of acetyl-CoA to triglycerides by encouraging uptake of glucose by adipocytes and promoting production of SREBP1 (sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1). SREBP1 regulates fatty acid, triglyceride and cholesterol synthesis[@Frayn2003; @Luo2016]. In addition, lipoprotein lipase plays a key role in hydrolysing circulating triglycerides into fatty acids enabling their uptake by adipocytes[@Frayn2003]. Though they can expand, individual adipocytes have limited storage capacity for triglycerides. Once *full*, adipocytes have the ability to multiply[@Frayn2003]. The amount of expansion adipocytes can achieve is limited[@Frayn2003; @Gray2007] and thought to be influential in the rate of adipogenesis, the rate of fat mobilisation around the body and the development of disease[@Gray2007].<br>

### Insulation
Energy storage of fats is managed predominantly by white adipose tissue. These deposits are located mainly within subcutaneous tissue. During infancy, brown adipose tissue is abundant; however, as humans age these deposits *whiten* leaving few adult brown fat deposits. The remaining deposits of brown adipose tissue in adults are located around the neck, thoracic section of the spine, aortic body, and adrenal glands; all locations with high blood flow[@Cannon2004; @Luo2016]. Thermogenesis by these tissues is regulated by the hypothalamus and is achieved by uncoupling of the respiratory chain of oxidative phosphorylation via UCP1 (uncoupling protein 1). When this process is active, lipids and glucose are used as fuel[@Cannon2004]. Due to the abundant vascularization of areas where brown adipose tissue is located the heat generated from this process is quickly distributed via the circulatory system. In addition, white adipose tissue can undergo a *beiging* process taking on thermogenic properties of brown adipose tissue. Beige adipose tissue is a half way point between white and brown adipose tissue and is more widely dispersed than brown adipose tissue, being located mainly within subcutaneous white adipose tissue. Beige adipose tissue, much like brown adipose tissue, is cold activated but can be recruited through signalling that mimics the stressed state induced by cold. The *beiging* process is not well characterized but is thought to be a result of signalling changes during differentiation of preadipocytes[@Luo2016]. The *beiging* process is reversible but has been suggested as a therapeutic avenue for weight loss [@Cannon2004]. <br> 

### Signalling
It is important to consider adipose tissue as an organ in its own right. Not solely comprised of adipocytes, adipose tissue includes a multitude of tissues and cells including connective and nerve tissues and immune cells. All respond to, and secrete, signalling molecules locally and systemically. It is thought this signalling is primarily to maintain appropriate energy stores and includes signals influencing deposition and mobilisation of fats and differentiation of new adipocytes[@Frayn2003; @Kershaw2004; @Luo2016]. Functionally, signalling molecules have metabolic effects and/or are involved in steroid hormone production[@Kershaw2004]. <br>

Adipogenesis, the process of adipocyte formation, has been well characterized and PPAR$y$ (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor $y$) is the master regulator[@Frayn2003; @Luo2016]. Over-expression of PPAR$y$ leads to differentiation and under-expression results in lipodystrophy. Other signalling molecules such as KLFs (Kruppel-like factors) and C/EBPs (CCAAT-enhancer-binding proteins) influence adipogenesis through PPAR$y$[@Luo2016]. Because of the master regulatory function of PPAR$y$, exploring regulatory function and expression has been considered as a potential therapeutic avenue for obesity[@Lee2014; @Luo2016]. Though not well characterized, brown adipocytes are thought be influenced heavily by PRDM16 and PGC1$a$, with the latter required for thermogenesis and not necessarily adipogenesis[@Luo2016]. The breakdown of stored triglycerides via lipolysis results in the release of fatty acids and glycerol molecules for oxidation and gluconeogenesis respectively. Fatty acids can also be broken down into ketone bodies via ketogenesis. While insulin abundance activates lipogenesis, the relative absence of insulin promotes lipogenesis. The lipolytic pathway, which is also activated by cAMP-dependent (cyclic adenosine monophosphate) PKA (protein kinase A), relies on the function of ATGL (adipocyte triglyceride lipase) and HSL (hormone sensitive lipase) to catalyse the hydrolysis of triglycerides to di- and mono-glyceride's respectively. Inhibition of ATGL can result in impaired lipolysis and obesity[@Schreiber2019]. <br>

The signalling molecules adipocytes produce, known as adipokines, are numerous and act on the auto- and endo-crine systems[@Lehr2012; @Fasshauer2015]. There are adipose deposit specific effects on expression and secretion of adipokines and the movement these adipokines can be expected to undertake. Subcutaneous adipose tissue adipokines travel through the systemic system while visceral adipose tissue adipokines can travel via the portal system with direct access to the liver. Adipocyte receptors are also expressed differentially based on deposit location[@Kershaw2004]. The main adipokines (Figure \@ref(fig:adipokines)) produced by adipocytes are leptin and adiponectin which function to regulate metabolism and inflammation systemically. Other cells within the adipose tissue, including immune and endothelial cells, produce much of the other adipokines such as TNF$a$ (tumour necrosis factor $a$) and IL6 (interleukin 6)[@Luo2016]. <br>

<!--- Nic said:
What is this evidence though??

Adiponectin has an inverse association with health outcomes, but the MR analyses are largely null… 

This is the zone in which this thesis sits and I would be careful in the reproduction of published material here which is at odds with the causal evidence and which you then go on to look at (albeit with metabolites as your intermediate)… 
--->
Abnormal levels of adipokines are harmful, as they lead to impaired adipose tissue function and subsequent downstream effects such as insulin resistance[@Bluher2013; @Bluher2015; @Fasshauer2015; @Luo2016]. As adipose tissue abundance increases so too does the likelihood of abnormal levels of adipokines. This is of particular interest as adipokine levels can change as a result of diseases such as obesity, thus introducing feed-back loops which serve to alter normal processes[@Bluher2013; @Fasshauer2015]. However, there are outstanding questions about how abnormal levels of adipokines leads to the development of disease[@Fasshauer2015]. For detailed discussion of adipokines and the pathways that lead to their production, which is not in the scope of this thesis, see[@Kershaw2004; @Bluher2013; @Bluher2015; @Fasshauer2015; @Luo2016].<br>

<!--- Nic: Would try to redraw these figures in your own way to support your point – reproductions are ok (which is one online), but you may want to be saying that these adipose/adipokine relationships are interesting, but the links to disease are not well established /// more needed in this field etc… --->

### Genetics
<!--- 
Include genetics of all adipsoooity measures

I was expecting to see more direct ref to/discussion of BMI GWAS stuff here

It seems like this introduction has mainly focused on adipocytes but you’re talking about adiposity. Yes, of course adipocytes are a component of adiposity but the primary focus should be, here, the genetics of adiposity, which you can break down into component parts such as adipokines etc.

Are you implying that this is direct or the result of just having more adipose around? - in reference to first sentence

There clearly needs to be a discussion of the genetics of adiposity here – even if followed up in greater detail later
--->
Production of adipokines, though partly a response of afferent signalling, is also a result of adipocyte genetics. This is also the case for lipogenesis, storage capacity, lipolysis, mobilisation of fat deposits and energy expenditure[@Dahlman2010]. A number of adipose specific genes have been identified including *LEP*[@Pan2018; @Ahn2019], *ADIPOQ*[@Achari2017], and *PPAR$y$*[@Lefterova2009; @Ahn2019] encoding the adipokines leptin and adiponectin and the adipose-specific transcription factor PPAR$y$. These, and other genes[@Ahn2019], are expressed differently in subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue as well as in non-adipose tissue[@Ahn2019]. Differential expression along with the presence of adipose-specific genes is associated with obesity and related diseases[@Ahn2019]. For example, *SLC19A3* is an adipose-specific gene[@Ahn2019] encoding a thiamine transporter; thiamine dependent enzymes have been associated with obesity[@Maguire2018]. As adipocyte expandability is limited, and given that an excess of fatty acids results in increased adipogenesis[@Frayn2003; @Gray2007], it is possible that expandability is fixed by adipose-specific genes and expression. This may have an impact on the development of diseases such as type-2 diabetes where incidence differs between different ancestral populations with the same BMI[@Ma2013a].

## Body mass index and disease {#BMI-and-disease}
With obesity responsible for 8% of premature deaths per-year[@Stanaway2018] and more people expected to be overweight or obese in the coming years[@Ng2014; @NCD-RisC2016; @Abarca-Gomez2017] it is important to understand how increased adiposity leads to mortality. Large scaleliterature searching (see Supplementary \@ref(#chapter1-appendix)) highlights the broad array of diseases and complications linking BMI and mortality. These diseases and complications can broadly be categorised as: `r levels(MELODI_final_table$Category)`, where *other* includes disease like diabetes and the metabolic syndrome (Table \@ref(tab:chapter1-table-MELODI)). <br>

<!--- Talk about each disease category and reference multiple papers 

Despite melodi – which may represent a good, but small intro contribution – this section has not really discussed the BMI disease link or the key question for your work (I think) which is the extent of the BMI / disease link which cannot be treated – i.e. that after impact on BP/lipids/etc…

Completely agree – you need to show then digest the results from MELODI but then refer back to previous literature

## Underlying aetiology of the BMI disease relationship {#chapter1-underlying-aetiology}
Although associated with many of the same diseases, the underlying aetiology of the relationships between BMI, WHR and BF with these diseases is not clear. For quality of life, the relationship is mostly explained by the presence of co-morbidities which increases the likelihood of poor outcomes. Stigmatisation as a result of increased fat mass may also be involved in poor quality of life[@Bray2004; @Haslam2005]. Similarly, the relationship with many sleep complications is likely a result of chronic pulmonary diseases -- distribution of fat mass around the neck may also be important[@Bray2004; @Haslam2005; @Poulain2006]. <br>

Type 2 diabete development is likely to follow a process of impaired glucose clearance as a result of increased adiposity, which leads to increased insulin resistance. There are likely wider metabolic changes that influence this process which are also a consequence of increased adiposity[@Bray2004; @Haslam2005; @Collaboration2009]. Respiratory diseases are likely a result of reductions in FEV1, FVC, lung and residual capacity, and expiratory reserve. Each of these is a consequence of weakened muscles and reduced compliance of the chest which can be caused by the physical burden of increased adiposity around the chest and lungs[@Haslam2005; @Poulain2006]. With respiratory disease there is also the prospect of confounding as a result of smoking status, which increases with increased adiposity[@Carreras-Torres2018]. In the case of cardiovascular disease, hypertension may be related to changes in: sympathetic activity, blood flow and viscosity, and dietary intake as a result of increased adiposity[@Bray2004; @Haslam2005; @Jayedi2018]. Some of these changes might similarly be a result of metabolic, inflammatory and hormonal changes. Both dyslipidemia and reductions in HDL result from increased adiposity and these changes may be important in development of heart disease. <br>

Unlike diabetes and respiratory diseases, most other diseases have a less well understood process of development as a result of increased adiposity. Increased adiposity is associated with numerous types of cancer. Hypotheses for these associations differ based on the type of cancer. Metabolic, inflammatory and hormonal changes as a result of increased adiposity are proposed as leading to the development of a number of different cancers[@Bray2004; @Haslam2005; @Collaboration2009; @Bhaskaran2014]. <!-- go into more detail -->

The location of fat deposits may also be important (e.g. deposition of adipose tissue around the heart may result in inflammation of the myocardium, but this might also be subsequent to dyslipidemia and reduction in HDL [@Bray2004; @Haslam2005; @Collaboration2009; @Dagfinn2016]). Osteoarthritis, though likely a result of the physical burden of increased adiposity, may also be a product of changes to cartilage and bone metabolism[@Bray2004; @Haslam2005]. Similar metabolic changes may play a role in a number of other diseases. An increased risk of gallstones is associated with increased cholesterol[@Bray2004] and increased salt intake has been suggested as a potential link between increased adiposity and stroke[@Haslam2005; @Collaboration2009]. <br>

The body of work investigating associations between increased adiposity and disease is extensive. Many proposed mechanisms of disease development invovle the physical burden of fat mass and/or changes to different pathways, particularly metabolic changes. However, the potential for residual confounding and reverse causation in these studies warrants further investigation using methods robust to there challenges. <br>

<!--End this section on (1) inconsistencies / more data required, (2) using methods that improve causal inference and (3) understand mechanisms linking everything together. You can then talk about (2) and (3) after this.  -->

## Mendelian randomization {#mendelian-randomization}
Studies investigating the associations between increased adiposity and metabolites and metabolites and disease are important and, when conducted in optimal conditions provide information on the potential causes and consequences of altered metabolic states. Even with optimal conditions observational studies hold a number of limitations that can not easily be overcome. These limitations, such as confounding and reverse causation, can lead to biased results[@DaveySmith2014; @Timpson2005; @CCGC2011; @Yarmolinsky2018]. Simply put, though a study may identify an association between two traits does not mean that one causes the other; they may be correlated because of shared causes for instance. <br> 

In observational epidemiology, ideally we want to compare individuals based on the exposure and so attempt to control the experiment by accounting for confounderis. In this regard we attempt to replicate a randomised control trial, wich is  the gold standard for testing causality. However, the large costs and time required to develop, implement and analyse results limits their use. More importantly, randomizing individuals to conditions known to be associated with harmful outcomes is ethically wrong. An alternative approach is to utilise the large amounts of data that are publicly available or that can be accessed through institutions. Causal inference methodologies have been established to exploit the availability of these data sets. <br>

Mendelian randomization (MR), described[@DaveySmith2003; @DaveySmith2003; @Davies2018] and reviewed[@Burgess2015; @Bowden2019] elsewhere, and accompanied by a [dictionary](https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/6yzs7) of terms[@Lawlor2019], is a statistical methodology that uses genetic variants as instrumental variables to investigate the causal relationship between an exposure and outcome[@DaveySmith2003; @Smith2004]. The reassessment of many observational associations has provided strong evidence for the relationships between risk factors and diseases, but has also highlighted the biases and limitations of observational research[@Timpson2005; @CCGC2011; @Yarmolinsky2018]. <br>

Briefly, individuals inherit alleles largely at random from their mother and father. Across a large population this leads to the even distribution of confounders between the effect and non-effect alleles. As such, individuals differ because of the expressed allele rather than their environmental circumstances. This random allocation of genetic variants, which may ultimately be related to a health outcome, is analogous to a randomised control trial where geneotype groups act as the intervention and non-intervention arms of the trial. <br>

Inference derived from MR analyses relies up-on three assumptions (Figure \@ref(fig:chapter1-figure-mr-dag)): (i) the instrumental variable ($Z$) is robustly associated with the exposure ($X$), (ii) there is no independent association of the instrumental variable with the outcome ($Y$) other than through the exposure, (iii) the instrumental variable is independent of measured or un-measured confounders ($U$). <br>

```
\noindent
\bsmall
*$Z$ = instrumental variable; $X$ = exposure; $Y$ = outcome; $U$ = confounders.* <br>
\esmall

Additional assumptons based on homogeneity, monotonicity, and effect modification are also present. The homogeneity assumption assumes the assoication between the IV and the is exposure or the effect of the exposure on the outcome is homogeneous. That is, the association or the effect is the same for all individuals in the population. Monotonicity can be deterministic or stochastic. Deterministic monotonicity assumes that the effect of the IV is consistent in all individuals of the population. That is, the effect of the IV does not increase the exposure in one group and decrease it in another. Stochastic monotonicity assumes deterministic monotonicity conditional on confounders. <br>

Based up-on Mendel's laws of inheritance, MR relies on the assumption that genetic variants are unlikely to be associated with one another (outside of linkage disequilibrium) or with environmental factors. Deviation from which would mean an uneven distribution of alleles across a population. Consideration in MR analyses should therefore also be given to dynastic effects, population structure, and assortative mating. Within family MR can be used to obtain the true causal effect in these situations[@Hartwig2018; @Brumpton2019]. <br>

Dynastic effects, a form of confounding, are a consequence of traits transmitted across generations which then influence the causal effect estimate[@Sanderson2019; @Brumpton2019]. That is, the parental genotype directly effects the offspring phenotype. For example, the effect BMI on cardiovascular disease may be biased by the instrumental variables for BMI being correlated across parent and offspring and the effect of maternal BMI on offspring development, which has an effect on future cardiovascular disease. In this instance the seond MR assumption would be violated. Within family studies are proposed, and simulations have shown, to overcome some of the consequences of dynastci effects[@Sanderson2019; @Brumpton2019]. <br>

Population structure is a result of allele frequency differning across geographic regions. This would violate the assumption that instrumental variables are independent of confounding factors. In MR analyses it is assumed that latent structure is accounted for in the genome-wide association study (GWAS) in which the instrumental variables are discovered[@Haworth2019]. As the sample sizes of GWAS's has increased the potential for subtle effects of population structure has been observed[@Haworth2019; @Berg2019]. <br> 

Assortative mating is the principle by which partners select one another based on a particular phenotype. This is either cross-trait (one trait selecting for another trait) or single-trait (one trait selecting for the same trait). MR results can be biased by both types of assortative mating, even when the phenotypes of interest are not those which influenced the mating[@Hartwig2018]. <br>

Canalization, whereby what would otherwise be developmentally deleterious genetic effects are nullified by compensatory mechanisms, is broadly equivalent to non-adherence in an RCT. Any effects of canalization would attenuate effect sizes[@Smith2004], however there are currently no methods to detect its presence in an MR context. The effects of canalization are unlikely to be present in MR studies which utilise maternal genotypes for environmental exposures of the offspring such as during gestation[@Smith2010]. For complex traits it is possible that canalization occurs at the level of the system rather than at the gene level[@Geiler-Samerotte2019]. As such, any outcome of a genetic mutation in regards to its role in the canal would likely be unpredictable. <br>

Methodological advances have enabled MR studies to be conducted with both individual level, known as one-sample MR, and summary level data obtained from published GWASs[@Pierce2013], known as two-sample MR. In both contexts, instrumental variables are often obtained from external GWAS's. Increasingly, these are large and well powered GWAS' able to idnetify ever increasing numbers of SNPs associatied with complex traits such as with BMI[@Speliotes2010a; @Shungin2015; @Locke2015; @Pulit2019; @Yengo2018]. As power has increased, the ability to detect SNPs with smaller effects and which explain ever smaller proportions of variance in BMI has increased[@Yengo2018]. This holds potential considerations in regards to population structure and the effects of an omnigenic model. <br>

As discussed, population structure was thought to have been an issue in smaller studies and could be accounted for by adjustment. However, well powered studies have shown both latent structure[@Haworth2019; @Berg2019] and an inability to perform adequate adjustemnt[@Sohail2019]. This has potential implications, not only for the effect sizes of associated SNPs but also for the identification of SNPs associated with the trait[@Sohail2019]. For example, a poorly or un-adjusted GWAS could identify SNPs associated with population differences rather than the trait of interest. <br>

In an omnigenic model, variance in a trait of interest is not solely a result of directly related genes (core-genes). Rather, all genes expressed in relevant cell types have an effect, however small, on the trait of interest[@Boyle2017]. These peripheral-genes, which have no obvious direct link to the trait of interest, are mostly in non-coding regions with regulatory functions[@Liu2019].Given that variants associated with complex traits are dispersed widely across the genome[@Liu2019] and that assigning a link between any particular SNP and an individual gene is difficult[@GTEx2013], variants associated with complex traits likely implicate many genes with the trait. Because many of these will be peripheral-genes they will ultimately have functions on other traits, which in an MR context may include the outcome and thus violate the exclusion restriction assumption. <br>

Additional considerations include random measurement error (random measurmeent in the exposure will bias towards the null, and increase the standard error if in the outcome), Winners curse (whereby discovery studies identify larger effects than those in replication studies), collider bias (conditioning on a variable by adjustment, restriction, or sampling can induce an association betwene $X$ and $Y$ biasing th estimate both away and towards the null), non-overlapping samples (specific to two-sample MR, where the exposure and outcome data are obtained from samples with shared individuals), horizontal pleiotropy (the instrumental variable has an affect on the outcome independent of the exposure), and vertical pleiotropy (the instrumental variable does not have an effect on the exposure directly but on traits that have an effect on the exposure). <br>

Among the considerations and limitations of MR, population stratification, horizontal pleiotropy and canalization are the most challenging to account for. Though one can restrict analyses to homogeneous groups, use principal components, and perform within family studies to examine and mitigate the effects of population stratification, biases (e.g. sampling bias) may still remain. Additionally, methods for assessing potential horizontal pleiotropy exist but formal assessment of the exclusion restriction assumption is not possible. Accounting for canalization is much harder and, though being aware of the underlying biology can inform ones analyses, methods for assessment do not exist. Unlike the other considerations, vertical pleiotropy does not necessarily bias MR results rather it highlights potential intermediates.<br>

Both one-sample and two-sample MR can be extended to investigate intermediates that sit on the causal pathway. Mediation analysis in MR is discussed in detail elsewhere[@Carter2020] and can be achieved using two-step[@Relton2012]/network MR[@Burgess2015b] and multivariable MR[@Sanderson2018] (MVMR). Briefly, mediation analysis is interested in identifying the total effetc, the direct effect, and the indirect effect; where all act in the same direction the proportion of the total effect explained by teh mediator (proportion mediated) can be calculated[@VanderWeele2016]. The total effect is the effect of the exposure on the outcome through all mediated pathways, the direct effect is the effect of the exposure on the outcome through all mediated pathways that are not the pathway of interest, the indirect effect is the effect of the exposure on the outcome through the mediator of interest. These analyses are predicated on the following assumptions: (i) that there is a causal effect of the exposure on the outcome and mediator and of the mediator on the outcome; (ii) that there is no confounding between exposure, mediator, and outcome; (iii) that there are no intermediate confounders; (iv) that there is no interaction between the exposure and mediator[@@VanderWeele2016]. <br>

In two-step MR (Figure \@ref(fig:chapter1-figure-mr-dag2)) the indirect effect is calculated by multiplying the effect of the exposure on the mediator and the effect of the mediator on the outcome. The three core MR assumptions (and all previous considerations) must still be met and also extended: (i) the instrumental variables ($Z$ & $Z2$) must be robustly associated with the exposure or intermediate only ($X$ and $M$), (ii) the instrumental variables for the exposure ($Z$) must not be associated with the intermediate ($M$) or the outcome ($Z$) other than through the exposure ($X$), and the intermediate instrumental variables ($Z2$) must not be associated with the exposure, and only with the outcome ($Y$) through the intermediate, (iii) the instrumental variables for the exposure and intermediate must not be associated with measured or unmeasured confounders. No interaction between exposure and mediator is also assumed. Two-step MR has been used[@Varbo2015; @Xu2017; @Marouli2019] and combined with MVMR[@Carter2019] to gain better insight into disease aetiology. <br>

*$Z$ = instrumental variable; $X$ = exposure; $M$ = intermediate; $U$ = confounders; $Z2$ = instrumental variable for $M$; $Y$ = outcome.* <br>
\esmall

Multivariable MR allows for the causal effects of multiple exposures on an outcome to be estimated[@Sanderson2018] (Figure \@ref(fig:chapter1-figure-mr-dag3)). The effect of each exposure is estimated conditional on the other exposures and thus provides a direct estimate of the effect. Figure \@ref(fig:chapter1-figure-mr-dag3) shows a simplified MVMR model with two exposures ($X$ and $X2$); the bidirectional line between exposure one and exposure two does not make an assumption about the exposure relationships. The indirect effect is estimated by subtraction of the direct effect from the total effect. The total effect is calculated using univariable MR. As with two-step MR, no interaction between exposure and mediator is assumed. Though a new approach, and still subject to the same assuptions as with two-step and univariable MR, MVMR has shown promise in elucidating underlying aetiology of complex traits[@Davies2019; @Carter2019; @Richardson2019; @Johnson2019]. <br>

Though two-step MR was devised with epigenetic mechanisms in mind[@Relton2012] and MVMR has shown promise investigating metabolic intermediates[@Richardson2019], their application to large omic data sets is yet to be shown. An alternative approach, which insted of estimating mediated effects looks for overlapping signals, may also be appropriate for omic data[NOTE: INSERT REF TO RCC PAPER]. In this regard, the effect of the exposure on the candidate intermediate and the effect of candidate intermediate on the outcome are ranked in terms of their effects. A candidate intermediate is considered to be a potential mediator if it ranks highly in both analyses. [NOTE: DISUCSS LIMITATIONS ONCE PAPER IS COMPLETED] <br>

## Metabolites {#metabolites}
Many of the diseases discussed (Section \@ref(chapter1-underlying-aetiology)) have hypothesised development processes involving metabolic, inflammatory and hormonal changes. As a complex signalling organ with both local and systemic effects, adipose tissue is likely to influence all three of these processes at both local and systemic levels. It is not within the scope of this thesis to investigate all three, but recent advances in measurement methodologies and the availability of large, and deeply phenotyped population based studies may now provide the data necessary to investigate metabolic effects. <br>

The metabolome, the total abundance of small-molecules, is a reflection of genetic and non-genetic factors and sits between the proteome and the phenotype[@Griffin2006; @Su2014; @Chu2019; @Wishart2019]. The metabolome can be separated into endogenous (internally produced) and exogneous (externally produced) metabolites, whereby the majority of metabolites are the result of cellular processes, with multiple functions including as energy, signalling, transportattion, and structural components. Metabolic effects can be far reaching and also include post-translational modifications[@Johnson2016; @Wishart2019]. During homeostasis metabolic effects are tightly controlled, however the many functions they play mean that imbalances can be detrimental[@Griffin2006; @Johnson2016; @Wishart2019]. <br>

Measurement of individual metabolites, at scale, is achieved predominantly through mass spectrometry (MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Both MS and NMR have differing limitations with full coverage of the metabolome not achieved by either. Complimentary usage of the two methods is desirable[@Fearnley2016]; however, as MS is destructive and both methods are costly this is not always possible. Many population-based studies have metabolomics data from only one measurement method limiting the number of metabolites available for analysis. <br>

The number, and type, of metabolites identified by MS and NMR methods is dependent upon whether a targeted, semi-targeted, or un-targeted approach is taken. Targeted metabolomics analysis uses an internal standard to characterize individual metabolites[@Roberts2012; @Liu2017b] whereas un-targeted metabolomics analysis measures all metabolites within a specified range[@Vinayavekhin2010; @Liu2017b]. Semi-targeted approaches use internal standards to quantify groups of metabolites with similar chemical structure[@Liu2017b]. Targeted studies are able to identify a handful of metabolites where as semi-targeted and un-targeted can identify hundreds to thousands. As targeted and semi-targeted methods use internal standards absolute quantification of metabolit abundance is possible. In un-targeted methods only relative quantification, the peak area of each metabolite in comparison to other samples, is possible[@Liu2017b]. <br>

The availability of well powered population studies with metabolomics data from targeted, semi-targeted, and un-targeted methods as well as matched genome-wide data has enabled a growth in metaboloite GWASs[@Fearnley2016; @Chu2019]. These studies have revealed large variations in the heritability of metabolites and numerous loci associated with their abundances[@Shin2014; @Kettunen2016; @Long2017; @Gallois2019; Lotta2020]. The public availability of these GWASs provides a unique opportunity to perform genetic epidemiology studies which can compliment the existing literature from observational association studies. <br>

Metabolites reflect the current condition and activity of an organism and vary in abundance depending on the state of the individual. This is particularly evident in fasted and non-fasted measurements[@Carayol2015; @Sedlmeier2018; @Teruya2019] but also in case control studies such as those focussing on diabetes[@Guasch-Ferre2016] and cancer[@Liesenfeld2013; @Johnson2016]. Differences are also apparent when studying complex traits such as BMI[@Moore2014; @Cirulli2019] as well as many more[@Wishart2018] - a searchable database of metabolite information, including links with disease, is available from [The Human Metabolome Database](hmdb.ca). <br>

These studies provide an overall assessment of the changes metabolites undergo as a result of different conditions but the relationship is not clear. Whether metabolites change as a result of a condition or lead to its development is an important question with potential clinical importance. Mutable, both from a genetic and non-genetic perspective, the metabolome can, with caution, be used to investigate the development of diseases[@Su2014; @Fearnley2016; @Chu2019]. Particular consideration should be given to the metabolomics approach (targeted, semi-targeted, untargeted) and whether individuals were fasted. Consideration should also be given to the fact that metabolomics analysis provides a snapshot of an individuals current state. Though few studies have investigated metabolomic stability in large populations, variability in metabolite measures is apparent[@Sampson2013; @Carayol2015; @Darst2019].

A key aspect of future work investigating relationships between metabolites and diseases are the interactions metabolites have with one another. The metabolome is a complex system involving feedback and feed-forward loops, this complexity means many metabolites are intercorrelated[@Rosato2018], have high genetic correlation[@Gallois2019] and share a common genetic architecture[@Shin2014; @Kettunen2016; @Long2017; @Gallois2019; @Lotta2020]. As such, a perturbation in a single metabolite rarely occurs in isolation. Investigating metabolites as grouped entities that represent the underlying complexity, rather than individual metabolites, may help to elucidate relationships with disease. <br>

## Aims {#aims}
Increased adiposity is a global health concern. Many of the consequence of increased adiposity are known but the underlying aetiology is not well understood. Adipose tissue is a prolific signalling organ with systemic effects some of which are likely to affect the metabolome. Individual metabolites have been associated with many diseases but the complexity of the network makes these analyses difficult. MR studies provide an opportunity to investigate and disentangle the complex relationship between exposure, intermediate and outcome. These studies must be approached carefully given the interrelatedness of metabolites. In light of these considerations this thesis aims to: <br>

<br>

* *Identify metabolites that sit on the causal pathway from increased adiposity to disease* 

<br>

### Objectives {#objectives}
In order to achieve this aim this thesis will investigate the following objectives:

1. Perform a systematic review (Chapter \@ref(chapter2)) of all MR studies in which a measure of increased adiposity was used as an exposure. The diseases identified in this work will guide the diseases investigated (Chapter \@ref(chapter9)). <br> 

\par

2. Identify and describe appropriate instrumentation of increased adiposity. The systematic review (Chapter \@ref(chapter2)) will provide information on current instrumentation practices for MR. I will use this information and test MR instrument assumptions using individual level data to select instruments for subsequent analyses (Chapters \@ref(chapter3) and \@ref(chapter4)). <br>

\par

3. Identify metabolites associated with increased adiposity in observational (Chapter \@ref(chapter4)) and MR settings (Chapter \@ref(chapter5)). 

\par

4. Gain overview of metabolic profiles to enable interpretation of analyses from Chapters \@ref(chapter4), \@ref(chapter5), and \@ref(chapter9) using visualisation tools (Chapter \@ref(chapter6)). <br>

\par

4. Implement methods to reduce the complexity of the metabolome and produce instruments for MR analyses (Chapters \@ref(chapter7) and \@ref(chapter8)). <br>

\par

5. Identify diseases associated with metabolites in an MR setting (Chapter \@ref(chapter9)) and present the investigated network of increased adiposity -> metabolites -> diseases. <br>

## Presentation of results
In this thesis large association analyses are conducted. The presentation and interpretation of this data is complicated by the highly inter-correlated nature of metabolomics data and the need to compare effects across multiple exposures, models and ages. To this effect, and discussed in detail in Chapter \@ref(chapter6), Circos plots have been used to visualise results. To aid interpretation of these going forward, and unless otherwise stated in the figure legend, the following applies:

* Each point represents a single test of an exposure on an outcome
* Labels around the edge of the plot represent outcomes
* Tracks represent a single variable (e.g. an exposure)
* Each point is accompanied by a 95% confidence interval
* Solid points represent a multiple testing threshold has been reached
* Data is split into sections (denoted by numbers) which is dictated by grouping outcomes by a variable (e.g. subclass)
